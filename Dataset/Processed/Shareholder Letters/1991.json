        "value": "This distinction is absolutely fundamental to understanding what you're really buying when you invest in a company, and it has enormous implications for valuation. A franchise and a business might both be profitable today, but their futures are completely different, and that's what determines their value.\n\nLet me start with what makes a franchise special. When you have a product or service that people need or want, that they believe has no close substitute, and that isn't subject to price regulation, you've got something wonderful. You can price aggressively and earn high returns on capital year after year. Think about what this really means: you have pricing power. You're not at the mercy of competitors or forced to accept whatever price the market dictates. Your customers will pay up because they don't see a good alternative.\n\nHere's the beautiful part about franchises: they can tolerate mismanagement. Now, I'm not advocating for bad management, but this characteristic tells you something profound about the economic structure of the business. If mediocre managers can't kill the franchise, it means the competitive advantage is deeply embedded in the business itself. It's structural, not dependent on brilliant execution every single day.\n\nA business, on the other hand, earns exceptional profits only under specific conditions: either it's the low-cost operator, or supply is temporarily tight. The problem is that tightness in supply rarely lasts. Competitors see those fat profits and rush in. Even if you're the low-cost operator through superior management, you face the constant threat of competitive attack. Someone's always trying to figure out how to do what you do, but cheaper. And here's the critical difference: poor management can kill a business. Without that structural advantage, execution becomes everything.\n\nNow, when something transitions from a franchise to a business, as we've seen with media properties, the impact on value is dramatic and goes far beyond the immediate earnings decline. This is what many investors miss. They see earnings drop by, say, twenty percent, and they think the business is worth twenty percent less. But that's not how it works at all.\n\nWhen media companies had franchise characteristics, they could price aggressively and didn't require brilliant management. Newspapers, television stations, and magazines had limited competition for people's attention and advertising dollars. But then the world changed. Cable television proliferated, entertainment options exploded, and consumers suddenly had vastly more choices. The problem is that demand is fixed—we've only got 500 million American eyeballs and 24 hours in a day. When supply of media options expands dramatically but demand can't grow, you get intense competition and market fragmentation.\n\nWhat this means is that media properties lost their pricing power. They started behaving like businesses instead of franchises. They now need tight cost control and excellent management just to maintain profitability. The margin for error disappeared. And because the future earnings stream became both lower and less certain, the valuation impact is multiplicative, not additive. You're not just capitalizing lower earnings; you're capitalizing them at a lower multiple because the quality of those earnings has deteriorated. That's why I said the impact on value goes far beyond the immediate effect on earnings. It's a double whammy that many investors failed to anticipate."

        "value": "This baseball analogy captures something essential about successful investing that most people completely miss. When I say you need to watch the playing field and not the scoreboard, I'm talking about focusing on business fundamentals rather than stock prices. The scoreboard—the stock price—is just a reflection of what's happening on the field. It doesn't determine the outcome; it reports it.\n\nLet me explain what watching the playing field really means. It means studying the actual business: understanding its competitive position, analyzing whether it's a franchise or just a business, evaluating management's capital allocation decisions, assessing the industry dynamics, and projecting future earning power. These are the things that will determine what the business is actually worth. The stock price today is just what other people think about these factors. It might be right, or it might be wildly wrong.\n\nHere's why this matters so much: prices will be determined by future earnings. Not by past earnings, not by what you paid for the stock, not by what the stock did last quarter, but by the cash that business will generate for its owners over time. If you're watching the scoreboard—obsessing over daily price movements, worrying about what the market thinks this week, reacting to volatility—you're letting the crowd's opinion drive your decisions. But the crowd is often wrong, especially in the short term.\n\nThink about what happens when investors watch the scoreboard instead of the field. They see a stock price going up and assume the business must be doing well. They see it going down and panic, thinking something must be wrong. They start making decisions based on price momentum, technical patterns, or what they think other investors will do next. This is completely backwards. The stock price is the output, not the input. It's the result of business performance over time, not the cause of it.\n\nI've seen this mistake play out repeatedly throughout my career. In the media industry example I discussed, nobody saw the deterioration coming—not lenders, not owners, not financial analysts. Why? Because they were watching the scoreboard. The stocks had done well for years, the businesses were profitable, and everyone assumed that would continue. They weren't watching the playing field, where fundamental changes were occurring. Retailing patterns were shifting, advertising choices were proliferating, and entertainment options were exploding. These were the real factors that would determine future earnings, but people were too focused on past results and current stock prices to notice.\n\nThe rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield, as I noted. It's easy to see what happened; it's much harder to see what's coming. But that's the job. You have to study the competitive dynamics, understand the business model, and think about how the future might differ from the past. That's watching the playing field.\n\nHere's the practical application: when you're evaluating an investment, start by completely ignoring what the stock has done recently. Don't let price movements influence your analysis of business value. Instead, ask yourself: What is this business's competitive position? Does it have franchise characteristics or is it just a business? What are the industry dynamics? How might they change? What will this company's earning power be five or ten years from now? Only after you've answered these questions should you look at the price and ask whether it makes sense relative to the value.\n\nThe reason investors get this backwards is human nature. Price movements are visible, immediate, and emotionally engaging. Business analysis is hard work that requires patience and independent thinking. It's much easier to react to the scoreboard than to do the difficult work of understanding what's actually happening on the field. But if you want to put runs on the scoreboard as an investor, you've got to focus on the fundamentals that will drive future business performance. That's where real investment returns come from, not from predicting what the stock price will do next week."

        "value": "The mathematics of valuation are absolutely fundamental to intelligent investing, and what I've described here illustrates one of the most important concepts you can grasp: small changes in assumptions can lead to enormous changes in what a business is worth.\n\nLet me walk you through this carefully. When we value a business, we're really asking ourselves what we'd pay today for all the cash we expect to receive in the future. Now, if you've got a business earning a million dollars after tax, and you believe those earnings will grow at 6% annually forever without requiring additional capital investment, you're looking at something quite wonderful. Using a 10% discount rate, that stream of growing cash flows is worth $25 million today. That's a 25 times multiple on earnings.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. If instead you believe that same million dollars represents a normal level of earnings that will simply bob around over time - sometimes up, sometimes down, but not really growing unless you plow more capital back in - well, now you're looking at a perpetuity without growth. That same discount rate of 10% gives you a valuation of just $10 million. Same business, same current earnings, but a 60% lower valuation.\n\nWhy does this happen? It's all about compounding. When earnings grow at 6% annually, you're not just getting that million dollars year after year. In year ten, you're getting substantially more. In year twenty, much more still. The cumulative effect of that growth, even at a seemingly modest 6%, is enormous when you're talking about perpetuity. Remove that growth assumption, and you've removed most of the value.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to media properties. For decades, newspapers and television stations were like royalty. They had what we call franchises - protected positions that allowed them to raise prices, grow earnings, and do it all while throwing off cash because they didn't need much capital reinvestment. Depreciation covered the modest capital expenditures they required. It was a beautiful business model.\n\nBut the world changed. The secular transformation I'm describing - and I want to emphasize secular, not cyclical - fundamentally altered the economics. New competition, fragmented audiences, and technological change weakened those franchises. Suddenly, the 6% perpetual growth assumption looked optimistic. The bob-around model looked more realistic.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean these are bad businesses or that they'll disappear. It means they're different businesses with different economics, and therefore they command different valuations. A dollar of earnings is still a dollar, whether it comes from a newspaper or a steel mill. But we pay different prices for those dollars based on what we expect them to do in the future.\n\nThe lesson here is crucial: you must constantly reassess your assumptions about a business's future. Don't fall in love with yesterday's story. The intrinsic value of our media investments declined materially not because the current earnings disappeared, but because the reasonable expectations for future earnings growth changed. That's just reality, and we have to face it honestly."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "This is one of our core operating principles, and it reflects a philosophy that goes well beyond simple financial calculation. Yes, we could sometimes redeploy capital more profitably by selling one asset and buying another, but we don't operate that way, and there are very good reasons for it.\n\nFirst, let me be clear about what we mean by permanent holdings. These are businesses we've bought outright or major stock positions in companies where we've signaled our intention to be long-term partners. The Buffalo News, our Washington Post holdings, Capital Cities/ABC - these weren't trades. They were commitments. When we buy a business outright, the sellers are often families or entrepreneurs who've built something over decades. They're choosing us as stewards of their life's work, often passing on higher offers from others. They trust us not to turn around and flip their business when we spot a better opportunity.\n\nIf we violated that trust, word would get around fast. And it should. We'd be breaking an implicit promise. The reputation damage would be severe and entirely deserved. More importantly, it would be wrong. We've built Berkshire on the idea that we're the buyer of choice for people who care about more than just the highest price. If we started acting like a typical conglomerate, constantly optimizing our portfolio, we'd lose that advantage permanently.\n\nNow, let's talk about the capital allocation question, because this is where people sometimes think we're being inefficient. They'll say, \"Warren, if you can earn 15% in business A but you're only earning 10% in business B, shouldn't you sell B and put more into A?\" On the surface, that sounds rational. But business isn't conducted on a surface level.\n\nConsider what happens when you're known as a seller. Managers become insecure. They start managing for the short term, trying to make the numbers look good so they don't get sold. They stop thinking like owners. The entrepreneurial spirit that made the business valuable in the first place starts to evaporate. You get a culture of fear rather than a culture of ownership.\n\nFurthermore, there's the tax friction. When we sell a successful business or investment, we're going to pay substantial capital gains taxes. That's a big hurdle to overcome. The new investment needs to be not just marginally better, but significantly better to justify the tax cost of switching. In many cases, we're better off just letting the decent business continue compounding, even if we've spotted something that looks more attractive.\n\nThere's also the knowledge problem. We know our existing businesses intimately. We understand their economics, their management, their competitive positions. A new opportunity, no matter how attractive it looks, carries uncertainty. Sometimes the devil you know really is better than the devil you don't.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something: this principle has costs. In the case of our media properties, we've watched intrinsic value decline due to secular changes in the industry. We're not happy about that. We're not pretending it didn't happen. But we made a commitment, and we're sticking to it. Charlie and I sleep well at night knowing we've kept our word.\n\nThis approach also sends a powerful message to the managers of our businesses and to potential sellers. They know we're in it for the long haul. That loyalty flows both ways. Our managers don't waste time worrying about being sold. They focus on running their businesses well. And when someone's thinking about selling us their company, they know we'll still own it decades later."

        "value": "Well, the See's Candy purchase was really one of our most important learning experiences, and I'm glad we made the mistake of undervaluing it but still got lucky enough to buy it anyway. When Charlie and I looked at See's in 1972, we were still too influenced by Ben Graham's approach of focusing heavily on tangible assets. We saw $7 million in tangible net worth and thought $25 million was stretching it. We were wrong, and that mistake taught us lessons worth billions of dollars in later decisions.\n\nWhat we came to understand is that the real value of a business lies not in its physical assets but in its economic franchise – its ability to earn high returns on invested capital over long periods. See's demonstrated this beautifully. From 1972 to 1991, sales grew from $29 million to $196 million, but more importantly, pre-tax profits grew from $4.2 million to $42.4 million. That's a ten-fold increase in profits. Now here's the key insight: this enormous profit growth didn't require massive capital investment. See's could grow its earnings without constantly needing to plow money back into the business.\n\nCompare this to a business with no franchise value. If you're in a commodity business, you might grow sales, but you'll need to invest heavily in new equipment, working capital, and facilities just to stand still competitively. Your return on incremental invested capital will be mediocre at best. But See's had something special – when people on the West Coast wanted to give a gift of boxed chocolates, they wanted See's. Not just any chocolate, but See's specifically. That's a franchise.\n\nThis franchise value meant See's could raise prices regularly without losing customers. People weren't buying commoditized chocolate; they were buying See's, with all the goodwill and positive associations that came with it. The company could earn exceptional returns on the capital employed in the business, and it could distribute most of its earnings to us rather than retaining them for reinvestment.\n\nThe lesson fundamentally changed how we think about valuation. We learned to pay up for businesses with strong franchises, excellent management, and the ability to deploy little incremental capital while growing earnings. This insight led directly to some of our best investments. When we later looked at companies like Coca-Cola, we weren't scared off by what seemed like a high price-to-book ratio. We understood we were buying an economic franchise that could compound value over decades without requiring proportional capital investment.\n\nThe irony is that we almost didn't learn this lesson because we nearly walked away from See's over a $5 million difference in price. If the sellers hadn't accepted our $25 million offer, we might have missed one of the most important educational experiences of our investing lives. It taught us that paying a fair price for a wonderful business is far better than paying a wonderful price for a fair business. That principle has guided Berkshire ever since."

        "value": "You discuss how most media companies loaded up on debt during the late 1980s while Cap Cities and Washington Post stayed disciplined with strong balance sheets. Why is this conservative financial approach so important, especially when the economics of an industry are deteriorating?"

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons in business management, and it's one that gets forgotten in every boom cycle. The media industry example illustrates perfectly why balance sheet strength matters most when you need it most – which is precisely when industry conditions deteriorate.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic. During the late 1980s, media properties were considered nearly invincible franchises. People thought newspapers and television stations had permanent competitive advantages that couldn't be eroded. In that environment, buyers paid irrational prices for media properties, and they financed these purchases with enormous amounts of debt. The thinking was: these businesses are so good, they'll easily cover the debt service, and we'll make a fortune on the leverage.\n\nBut here's what they missed: no franchise is truly bullet-proof forever. The economics of media businesses did deteriorate, as we noted in discussing the intrinsic value losses in our holdings. When that happened, companies with heavy debt loads found themselves in a terrible position. They had debt equal to five or more times their current net income. As earnings shrank, suddenly that debt went from manageable to suffocating. These companies had no flexibility. They couldn't invest in their businesses, couldn't weather downturns, couldn't take advantage of opportunities, and in some cases faced real survival questions.\n\nNow contrast that with Cap Cities and Washington Post. Both companies had essentially no net debt – their debt was roughly offset by cash. When industry economics deteriorated, the shrinkage in asset values wasn't accentuated by leverage working against them. They maintained their financial flexibility and their ability to make decisions based on what was right for the long term, not what their debt covenants required.\n\nThis illustrates a principle Charlie and I learned from observing many business cycles: leverage is most dangerous when it seems safest, and safety is most valuable when it seems unnecessary. During good times, debt looks costless. The interest is tax-deductible, returns on equity get magnified, and everyone assumes the good times will continue. But business cycles are inevitable. Industries change. Competition emerges from unexpected places. When conditions deteriorate, that's when you discover whether you built your house on rock or sand.\n\nThe media industry thought it had found the perfect business – local monopolies or oligopolies with high barriers to entry. But technology and changing consumer habits eroded those advantages faster than anyone expected. The companies that had borrowed heavily based on peak earnings found themselves in trouble. The companies that had stayed conservative, like our investees, could adapt and survive.\n\nThis is why we've always run Berkshire with minimal debt and why we admire managers like those at Cap Cities and Washington Post who resist the temptation to leverage up. We've seen too many companies with wonderful businesses get destroyed by debt. We've never seen a company get in trouble because it had too much cash and too little debt. Strong balance sheets give you staying power, flexibility, and the ability to act when others can't. In business, survival is the first priority, and excess debt is the biggest threat to survival when conditions change. It's that simple, and it's that important."

        "value": "The conventional wisdom about diversification is completely backwards for anyone who actually knows what they're doing. Let me be clear: spreading your money across dozens or hundreds of investments doesn't reduce your risk if you don't understand what you own. It just guarantees mediocrity.\n\nHere's the fundamental logic. When Charlie and I look at businesses, we're trying to find maybe a handful of companies that we can truly understand, that have durable competitive advantages, and that are run by people we trust. This is incredibly difficult work. If we're honest with ourselves, there just aren't that many businesses where we can confidently predict what they'll look like in ten or twenty years. So when we find one of these rare gems - a Coca-Cola, a Gillette, a Guinness - why on earth would we put just a tiny amount of money into it? That makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe mathematics of this are straightforward. If I can find three businesses that I truly understand and believe in, and I put significant capital into each of them, I'm going to do far better than if I spread that same capital across fifty businesses where I'm just guessing. With fifty holdings, maybe I understand five of them reasonably well, have a vague sense of another fifteen, and I'm really just hoping for the best with the other thirty. That's not risk reduction - that's risk creation through ignorance.\n\nThink about it the way I described in the excerpt. If I were limited to investing in private businesses in Omaha, I wouldn't try to own a piece of every business in town. I'd study them carefully, figure out which ones had the best economics and the best managers, and I'd put meaningful money into those few. The fact that I can buy publicly traded companies instead of private ones doesn't change this logic one bit. Actually, it makes it easier because public markets sometimes offer these wonderful businesses at sensible prices.\n\nKeynes understood this perfectly, and he was both a brilliant theorist and a successful practitioner. He said you should put fairly large sums into enterprises you know something about and in whose management you thoroughly believe. Notice he didn't say \"enterprises you've heard of\" or \"enterprises that are in a hot sector.\" He said enterprises you actually know something about. For most people, including most professional investors, that's a very short list.\n\nThe real risk in investing isn't having a concentrated portfolio of great businesses you understand. The real risk is owning a bunch of mediocre or poor businesses that you don't understand, which is exactly what over-diversification forces you to do. When you own fifty or a hundred stocks, you're kidding yourself if you think you really know what's going on in all those businesses. You're not an investor at that point - you're just a speculator hoping that the law of averages works in your favor.\n\nOur approach is simple: find the superstars, pay a sensible price, and stick with them. If at first you do succeed, quit trying. When you find something that works beautifully, the smart move is to do more of it, not to abandon it in search of your fiftieth-best idea."

Having a wonderful business and having a wonderful investment are two different things, and the bridge between them is the price you pay. Let me walk you through how Charlie and I think about this.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what makes economics \"mouth-watering.\" We're looking for businesses that can earn high returns on capital, that don't require massive reinvestment just to stay in place, and that have some kind of moat protecting them from competition. Coca-Cola and Gillette are perfect examples. People all over the world want these products, the companies earn money on every continent, and competitors have an incredibly difficult time displacing them. These aren't businesses that depend on having a genius CEO or catching the next trend. They're businesses with enduring competitive advantages.\n\nBut here's the critical part: even a business with wonderful economics can be a terrible investment if you pay too much. If we'd paid three times the right price for Coca-Cola, our returns would have been mediocre at best, no matter how well the business performed. This is why we need both elements - great business characteristics and a sensible purchase price. You can't substitute one for the other.\n\nNow, why do we emphasize sticking with proven products rather than constantly searching for new ideas? This goes back to a basic truth about investing: finding these great businesses is extraordinarily difficult. When I look at Guinness, Coca-Cola, and Gillette, I see companies that have demonstrated their economic power over decades. They've proven they can earn high returns, navigate different economic environments, and maintain their competitive positions. Why would I discard that proven quality to chase after something unproven?\n\nThink about the alternative approach, which is what most of Wall Street does. They're constantly flitting from flower to flower, as I put it. This month they're excited about some tech company, next month it's a retail chain, then it's an energy play. They're calling themselves investors, but really they're just traders hoping to guess right about short-term price movements. That's why I compared them to someone engaging in one-night stands rather than building a lasting relationship.\n\nThe mathematics of our approach are compelling. Let's say we own Coca-Cola, and it continues performing well. Every year we hold it, we're getting the benefit of that wonderful business compounding. We're not paying transaction costs. We're not paying taxes on gains we haven't realized. We're not spending time and energy analyzing replacement ideas. And perhaps most importantly, we're not running the risk of selling something we understand well to buy something we understand less well.\n\nOur motto - \"If at first you do succeed, quit trying\" - captures this perfectly. When you've found a great business run by great people, and you bought it at a sensible price, the smart move is usually to just sit there and let it compound. The biggest mistakes I've made in my career haven't been the businesses I bought that didn't work out. They've been the great businesses I sold too early because I was looking for something new.\n\nThis doesn't mean we never buy new things or that we hold everything forever regardless of circumstances. But it does mean we have a very high bar for replacing something proven with something unproven. The burden of proof is on the new idea to be clearly superior, not just marginally different."

When you make a mistake of commission - you buy something that turns out poorly - your loss is limited. If you invest a million dollars in a business that goes to zero, you've lost a million dollars. That's painful, but it's finite. However, when you make an error of omission on a truly great business, the cost compounds over decades and can reach staggering amounts. Look at my Fannie Mae blunder. We understood the business completely. David Maxwell was doing a superb job as CEO. The company was positioned to become a financial powerhouse. But because I got frustrated when the stock price rose while we were buying, I stopped purchasing shares. Then, in what I can only describe as a moment of complete amateurish behavior, I sold our position simply because I didn't like holding small positions. By the end of 1991, just a few years later, that mistake had cost Berkshire approximately $1.4 billion in gains we didn't make.\n\nThink about that number. We didn't lose $1.4 billion on a bad investment. We simply failed to make an investment we understood and should have made. The opportunity cost was enormous, and it would have continued compounding for years beyond 1991 if we had held the position. This is why errors of omission are so insidious - they're invisible to shareholders, they don't show up in our financial statements, but they're incredibly expensive.\n\nNow, I'm not talking about missing out on businesses we couldn't understand. Charlie and I will never develop the competence to spot the next Xerox or Apple in their early stages. Those aren't really mistakes because they were outside our circle of competence. The painful errors are the ones where the business is right in our wheelhouse - we understand it, we can see it's attractive, we could act - but we end up sucking our thumbs instead.\n\nThe lesson here is that investors need to be ready to act decisively when opportunity meets preparation. If you've done your homework, if you understand the business, if the price is right, and if management is excellent, you need to buy in scale. Don't let temporary price movements frustrate you into inaction. Don't let arbitrary rules about position sizes cause you to sell something wonderful. The cost of missing great opportunities far exceeds the cost of making the occasional mistake on something you actually buy. At least with commission errors, you learn something and the damage is limited. With omission errors, you just watch billions of dollars of value creation happen without you, and that's a truly expensive education."

I had no good business reason to sell those 7 million shares. The company was excellent, management was superb, and the future was bright. I sold simply because I didn't like holding small positions. That's not analysis - that's just silly.\n\nLet me be clear about what happened here. We started buying Fannie Mae with the intention of purchasing 30 million shares, which would have been a $350-$400 million investment. We understood the business completely because we'd owned it before. David Maxwell had done a superb job dealing with inherited problems and was building a financial powerhouse. Everything about the investment thesis was sound. But then the stock price started rising as we accumulated shares, and I made my first mistake - I stopped buying out of frustration with the rising price. This is amateurish behavior, and I'm embarrassed to admit it, but at least I learned from it. When Coca-Cola stock rose during our purchase program later, I didn't repeat this error.\n\nBut the second mistake was even worse. Instead of recognizing that the rising price actually validated our investment thesis - the market was beginning to recognize what we'd already seen - I compounded the error by selling our entire position. And why? Because holding a small position made me uncomfortable. I had this notion in my head that small positions weren't worth the bother, that we should either own meaningful stakes or nothing at all.\n\nThis kind of thinking is exactly backwards. The size of your position should be determined by the quality of the opportunity and the price you can obtain, not by some arbitrary preference about position sizing. If you can only buy a small amount of a wonderful business at a great price, you buy that small amount. You don't sell it because it's small. That's like refusing to pick up a hundred-dollar bill because you'd prefer to find a thousand-dollar bill.\n\nWhat makes this particularly painful is that I let a procedural preference override fundamental business judgment. I knew Fannie Mae was going to do well. I knew David Maxwell was an outstanding CEO. I knew the business model was sound. But I let my discomfort with small positions cause me to abandon a position in a business I understood and admired. The result? Berkshire missed out on approximately $1.4 billion in gains by yearend 1991, and that number would have grown substantially larger in subsequent years.\n\nThe broader lesson is this: never let arbitrary rules, personal preferences, or emotional reactions override sound business analysis. If you understand a business, if it's well-managed, if the economics are attractive, you hold it. You don't sell because the position is too small, or because you're frustrated with price movements, or because of any other reason unrelated to the fundamental business value. Every investment decision should be made on business merits, not on how it makes you feel or whether it fits some preconceived notion about portfolio construction. When you abandon this principle, as I did with Fannie Mae, you pay a very heavy price. I wish I could give you a rational explanation for my behavior, but I can't. It was simply a mistake, and an expensive one at that."
