As I mentioned in the letter, Charlie and I believe in having a rational and unbending standard that keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow lands and then painting the bull's eye around it. That's a critical distinction in how we think about measurement.\n\nNow, let me be clear about something important: over an extended period of time, stock price performance is actually the best test of how we've done. If we do our job well, the stock price will reflect that over the long haul. But here's the problem with using annual stock price changes as our measuring stick – they can be extraordinarily erratic year-to-year. The market is a voting machine in the short term, and those votes can be wildly emotional and disconnected from business reality. We might have a terrific year building value, but if the market happens to be in a pessimistic mood, our stock could decline. Conversely, we might have a mediocre year while the market decides to get euphoric about Berkshire.\n\nBook value gives us something more tangible and less subject to the market's mood swings. It measures the actual net worth we've built in the company – the retained earnings, the value of our businesses, the investments we've made. It's an objective scorecard that can't be manipulated by market sentiment. When book value per share grows by 19.8% in a year, as it did in 2009, that's real wealth creation that we can point to, regardless of what Mr. Market thinks on any given day.\n\nThe comparison to the S&P 500 is equally important to our measurement philosophy. We chose the S&P as our bogey for a simple reason: our shareholders can match its performance at virtually no cost by buying an index fund. So why should they pay us – through the costs embedded in running Berkshire – for merely duplicating what they could get elsewhere for almost nothing? We need to beat that benchmark, and beat it after taxes, to justify our existence as active managers of capital.\n\nThere's another crucial element here that the letter touches on. The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax, while Berkshire's are after-tax. This is a significant handicap for us. If a corporation simply owned the S&P 500 and paid the appropriate taxes, it would lag the index in positive years and exceed it in negative years. Over time, those tax costs create a substantial drag. So when we compare our after-tax book value growth to the pre-tax S&P returns, we're actually setting a higher bar for ourselves.\n\nOver those 45 years since present management took over, we've grown book value from $19 to $84,487 per share, compounding at 20.3% annually. That's our report card, and it's measured against a clear, unchanging standard. This approach has kept us focused on the fundamentals of building business value rather than trying to guess what the stock market will do next quarter or next year."

        "value": "You mention that the accounting rules changed in 1979 to require insurance companies to value equity securities at market rather than at the lower of cost or market.

        "value": "The accounting change in 1979 was actually quite significant for how we measure and report Berkshire's performance, and restating our historical results was essential to maintaining consistency and honesty in our long-term track record. Let me walk you through why this matters so much.\n\nBefore 1979, insurance companies were required to carry their equity securities at the lower of cost or market value. This created a conservative bias in the accounting, but it also introduced a fundamental distortion in how results were reported from year to year. Under the old rules, if we bought a stock for $100 and it went to $150, we'd still carry it on our books at $100 – no gain would be recognized in book value. But if that same stock fell to $75, we'd have to write it down immediately, showing a $25 loss in book value. You can see the asymmetry here – losses were recognized immediately, but gains were invisible until you sold the security.\n\nThis created a real problem for measuring performance consistently over time. In years when our stocks went up but we didn't sell them, our book value growth would understate the actual economic progress we'd made. Then when we eventually sold those appreciated securities, there'd be this artificial pop in book value that didn't reflect that year's actual performance – it reflected gains that had been building up, unreported, for years.\n\nWhen the accounting rules changed in 1979 to require marking securities to market value, it created a much more honest and economically accurate picture of our financial position. Now, if we own stocks worth $150 that we bought for $100, our book value reflects that $50 gain, whether we've sold them or not. This matches the economic reality – we're $50 richer, and our book value should show it.\n\nBut here's where the restatement becomes crucial. If we had left our pre-1979 results under the old accounting method while using the new method from 1979 forward, we'd be comparing apples to oranges. Our 45-year track record would be meaningless because we'd be measuring the first 14 years one way and the remaining years another way. That's exactly the kind of inconsistency that allows people to manipulate their reported results and fool themselves – and others – about their true performance.\n\nBy restating the earlier years to conform to the market-value approach, we created a consistent measuring stick across the entire period. Now when we say book value has grown from $19 to $84,487 at a 20.3% compound annual rate, every year in that calculation is measured the same way. The comparison is valid and meaningful.\n\nThis gets back to our philosophy about having a rational and unbending standard. We can't have it both ways – we can't use one set of rules when they make us look good and another when they don't. The integrity of our measurement system depends on consistency. Our shareholders deserve to know how we've actually performed, measured by a single standard that doesn't change based on convenience or accounting fashion.\n\nThis principle extends beyond just accounting rules. In everything we do at Berkshire, we try to report our results in a way that we'd want them reported to us if our positions were reversed. That means being consistent, being conservative when there's doubt, and never gaming the numbers to make ourselves look better than we actually are."

        "value": "You mention that book value is a \"crude proxy\" for intrinsic value and that it understates Berkshire's true worth, especially in the insurance business.

        "value": "We use book value because it's the best imperfect tool we have available for tracking our progress over time, even though Charlie and I know full well that it significantly understates what Berkshire is actually worth. Let me explain why we stick with this approach despite its obvious limitations.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that intrinsic value—what a business is really worth—simply cannot be calculated with precision. It's not like measuring the temperature or weighing something on a scale. Intrinsic value depends on estimates of future cash flows, appropriate discount rates, competitive advantages that may or may not persist, and countless other variables that require judgment calls. Two equally intelligent people can look at the same business and come up with meaningfully different intrinsic values, and neither would necessarily be wrong.\n\nSo we needed something objective, something that couldn't be manipulated or subject to our own wishful thinking. Book value gives us that. It's right there in black and white on the balance sheet. Every year we can measure how much it changed per share, and we can compare that to how the S&P 500 performed. There's no ambiguity, no room for us to move the goalposts or redefine success after the fact.\n\nNow, the gap between book value and intrinsic value at Berkshire has actually widened over the years, and that's largely a good thing—it means we've built up economic goodwill that doesn't show up on the books. Our insurance operations are the prime example. When we hold float—money that belongs to policyholders but that we get to invest—that creates enormous value. If we can underwrite at a profit, we're essentially getting paid to hold other people's money and invest it. That's extraordinarily valuable, but it doesn't show up as an asset on our balance sheet the way it should if we were measuring true economic value.\n\nSimilarly, many of our operating businesses have built up customer loyalty, brand value, and competitive positions that are worth far more than the historical cost at which we carry them. When we buy See's Candies or Nebraska Furniture Mart, we pay for that goodwill, and it goes on our books. But when these businesses generate additional goodwill through years of excellent operations, that increased value is invisible in book value—it only shows up as higher earnings.\n\nThe key insight for shareholders is this: book value gives you a conservative, consistent measuring stick. When we tell you that book value has compounded at 20.3% annually since 1965, you can take that to the bank—it's an objective fact. But you should also understand that the actual value creation has been even better than that, because the gap between book value and intrinsic value has widened. We're not trying to hide behind book value or use it to make ourselves look better. Quite the opposite—we're using the most conservative, verifiable metric available, knowing full well that it understates our progress. That's the kind of scorekeeping that lets shareholders trust the numbers they're seeing."

        "value": "Size is an anchor on performance, and there's simply no way around this mathematical reality. It's one of the most important things for Berkshire shareholders to understand, because I want you to have realistic expectations about what we can deliver going forward.\n\nLet me walk you through why this happens. When Berkshire was small, we could move the needle with relatively modest investments. If we found a wonderful business we could buy for ten million dollars that would compound at high rates, that acquisition could meaningfully impact our overall returns. Today, Berkshire has hundreds of billions in equity. To move the needle now, we need to deploy billions of dollars at a time, not millions. The universe of opportunities large enough to matter to us has shrunk dramatically.\n\nThink about it this way: there are thousands of businesses in America worth ten million dollars where an astute buyer might achieve excellent returns. There are hundreds worth a hundred million. But there are only a handful worth ten billion or more, and we're competing with everyone else who has large amounts of capital for those few opportunities. It's simple arithmetic—the bigger you get, the harder it becomes to find investments large enough to impact your results.\n\nThis size problem shows up in several ways. First, we can't invest in smaller, faster-growing companies that might offer the best percentage returns. Second, when we do find large opportunities, we often can't buy the whole company, so we end up owning a minority stake where we can't control operations or capital allocation. Third, our sheer size makes it harder to move in and out of positions—if we tried to buy or sell billions of dollars of stock quickly, we'd move the market against ourselves.\n\nThe excerpt mentions Steve Ballmer at Microsoft and Jeff Immelt at GE, and their situations illustrate another aspect of the size problem. When you inherit a company trading at nosebleed valuations, you're starting from a nearly impossible position. The market has already priced in years of perfect execution. Even if you do a good job, the stock may go nowhere or decline simply because it was overvalued when you started. Size often correlates with high valuations, making the performance bar even higher.\n\nNow, here's what I want shareholders to understand about Berkshire's future: we will almost certainly not compound book value at 20.3% annually going forward. That's just mathematical reality. But we have some meaningful advantages that should allow us to continue doing better than average, even if not spectacularly so. Our decentralized structure lets our managers maximize their talents without bureaucratic interference. Our permanent capital base means we never have to sell something we want to keep. Our insurance operations give us low-cost float to invest. And our reputation helps us get first call when families want to sell wonderful businesses.\n\nThe track record shows our defense has been better than our offense—we've outperformed the S&P in all eleven years when it delivered negative results. That defensive strength comes from our financial fortress balance sheet, our diverse business mix, and our discipline about not overpaying. As we get larger, this defensive advantage becomes relatively more important, because we're less likely to hit home runs but we're also less likely to strike out.\n\nSo yes, size is a drag, and yes, that drag will increase. But Berkshire still has many outstanding businesses and great managers operating in an unusual culture. Shareholders should expect decent returns over time, just not the extraordinary returns of our early decades."

        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons Charlie and I have learned, and it's saved us from countless mistakes over the decades. The answer is straightforward: knowing that an industry will grow dramatically tells you almost nothing about whether you'll make money investing in it. In fact, some of the most spectacular industry growth stories have produced the most spectacular investor losses.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When you look at autos in 1910, aircraft in 1930, or television sets in 1950, any intelligent observer could see these industries were going to transform the world. And they did! The growth was even more fabulous than people imagined. But here's what matters for investors: how did the companies in those industries actually perform? The answer is that most of them failed completely, and even the survivors often delivered poor returns to their shareholders. The graveyards are full of companies that made products everyone wanted and that changed the world.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because growth attracts competition like honey attracts bears. When an industry shows promise, capital floods in. Entrepreneurs and established companies alike pile into the space. What follows is a brutal battle for supremacy where companies slash prices, pour money into research and development, build excess capacity, and generally do whatever it takes to gain market share. This competitive dynamic decimates profit margins and returns on capital. You might sell millions of units and still go bankrupt because you're selling them at a loss or barely breaking even.\n\nThe airline industry is a perfect example, though it's not in this particular excerpt. The industry has grown spectacularly and moved billions of passengers, but it's destroyed shareholder value for decades. If a capitalist had been at Kitty Hawk in 1903, he should have shot Orville Wright down – it would have saved investors countless billions of dollars.\n\nWhat Charlie and I look for instead is predictability in the profit picture. We want businesses where we can reasonably estimate what the competitive dynamics will look like not just next year, but ten or twenty years from now. We want to understand who will have pricing power, what the returns on capital will be, and whether the company can maintain its competitive position without constantly having to reinvent itself or fight off new competitors.\n\nThis means we pass on lots of exciting opportunities. We've missed out on Amazon, Google, and countless other successful technology companies. But we've missed them not because we didn't think they'd grow or even that they'd be successful. We missed them because we couldn't evaluate with confidence what their competitive positions and profit margins would look like far into the future. The technology landscape changes too rapidly, and the competitive dynamics are too unpredictable for us.\n\nNow, we still make plenty of mistakes even in businesses we think we understand. But we're trying to play a game where the odds are in our favor. We'd rather invest in a business with predictable seven percent annual returns than swing for the fences in an industry that might return fifty percent or might go to zero. The predictability is what lets us sleep at night and compound our capital steadily over time. That's the whole ballgame in investing."

We will always arrange Berkshire's affairs so that we never need anyone's permission or assistance to survive and prosper. This isn't just conservative management – it's the foundation that allows us to be aggressive when opportunities arise.\n\nLet me explain the reasoning. When you're dependent on external financing or the kindness of strangers, you're vulnerable at exactly the wrong moments. Financial panics and economic crises don't arrive on schedule. They come when you least expect them, and they come fast. If your survival depends on being able to borrow money or sell assets in those moments, you're at the mercy of a system that may have completely seized up. You become a forced seller or a desperate borrower, and that's when you get terrible terms or can't transact at all.\n\nWe saw this play out in vivid detail in September 2008. The financial system went into cardiac arrest. Credit markets froze. Counterparty risk became paramount. Companies that had operated successfully for decades suddenly couldn't fund their daily operations. Some of these were well-managed businesses with sound underlying economics, but they'd structured their affairs in ways that required them to access capital markets regularly. When those markets shut down, they were in mortal danger.\n\nBerkshire was in the opposite position. We had massive liquidity and no need for external financing. Our diverse collection of businesses was generating billions in earnings that flowed to headquarters. We had no debt maturities to worry about, no margin calls to meet, no commercial paper to roll over. This meant we could be a supplier of capital when everyone else desperately needed it. We invested $15.5 billion at attractive terms precisely because we'd maintained our financial fortress during the good times.\n\nNow, you're right that we pay a steep price for this. That $20 billion or more in cash and cash-equivalents that we typically hold earns very little. At current rates, it's earning almost nothing. If we deployed that cash into our operating businesses or acquisitions, we'd earn much higher returns. Over a decade, the opportunity cost runs into many billions of dollars. Our shareholders are paying real money for our conservative balance sheet.\n\nBut here's how I think about that trade-off. First, that liquidity is constantly being refreshed by earnings from our businesses. It's not dead money sitting there – it's a revolving fund that grows over time. Second, and more important, this financial strength gives us two enormous advantages that more than compensate for the opportunity cost.\n\nThe first advantage is survival. We will never face a situation where Berkshire's existence is threatened by financial markets or economic conditions. We can't be forced into bad decisions. We can wait out any storm. This means we can structure our affairs for the long term without worrying about short-term volatility or liquidity crunches.\n\nThe second advantage is opportunity. When chaos reigns and everyone else is desperate for cash, we can act. We can make large commitments quickly. We can provide capital on attractive terms. We can buy wonderful businesses at fair prices because we're the only call a seller needs to make. The deals we did in 2008 and 2009 wouldn't have been possible if we'd been fully invested and dependent on external financing ourselves. Those opportunities alone have more than paid for decades of holding excess cash.\n\nSo yes, we pay a price for our financial strength. But it's a price we're happy to pay because it ensures we'll be around and ready when the really important moments arrive."

Yes, we're giving up returns we could earn by putting that money to work elsewhere, but that's a price we're happy to pay because it lets us sleep well at night, and more importantly, it positions us to act when others can't.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When you're running an insurance operation like we do, you're taking in premiums today and promising to pay claims tomorrow—sometimes many years from tomorrow. Our policyholders are counting on us to be there, no matter what happens in the economy or financial markets. That's a sacred obligation. We can't be in a position where we might have to sell assets at distressed prices or go hat-in-hand to banks or the capital markets during a crisis. The insurance business attracts a lot of companies that chase underwriting profits aggressively and invest their float in riskier assets to boost returns. When times are good, they look brilliant. But when trouble hits—and trouble always hits eventually—some of them get into serious difficulty. We've seen it happen over and over again throughout insurance history.\n\nOur approach is completely different. We want to be the Gibraltar of the insurance world. When policyholders, regulators, and counterparties look at Berkshire, we want them to see absolute, unquestioned financial strength. This reputation is worth far more than the investment returns we sacrifice by holding cash. It allows us to write business that others can't. It gives our operating managers confidence to make long-term decisions without worrying about the parent company's stability.\n\nBut there's another crucial dimension to this that's even more important from an investment standpoint. That cash position isn't just defensive—it's offensive. When financial chaos erupts, as it inevitably does every few years, we're in a position to act while others are paralyzed. In 2008 and 2009, when credit markets froze and even strong companies couldn't access capital, we were able to make investments in Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and others on extremely attractive terms. We could do that because we had the cash and the certainty that we wouldn't need it for our own operations.\n\nThink of it this way: a baseball analogy works well here. We don't have to swing at every pitch. We can wait for the fat pitch, and when it comes, we can swing hard because we've kept our powder dry. Most investors and companies can't do this. They're always fully invested, always optimized for normal conditions. When the extraordinary opportunity arrives, they're either tapped out or they're in trouble themselves.\n\nThe steep price we pay in forgone returns during normal times is really just the cost of maintaining optionality and strength. Over the long term—and we think in terms of decades, not quarters—this approach has served our shareholders extraordinarily well. We've been able to make enormous investments at attractive prices precisely because we maintained that financial fortress when it seemed expensive to do so."

Let me explain why we're so convinced of this, even though it means we occasionally get surprised by problems we didn't see coming.\n\nWhen you have 257,000 employees across hundreds of operating units, you face a choice. You can either build a traditional corporate structure with layers of management, committees, budget reviews, and oversight—or you can trust your managers and let them run their businesses. Most large companies choose the first path because it feels safer and more controlled. We've deliberately chosen the second path, and here's why.\n\nThe managers running our subsidiaries are, in most cases, people who built those businesses or who have deep expertise in their industries. They know their customers, their competitors, and their operations far better than Charlie and I ever could. When you insert layers of corporate oversight, you're essentially telling these talented people that they need permission to do their jobs. You're slowing them down, second-guessing them, and gradually you're changing their psychology from owners to employees.\n\nThis psychological shift is enormously destructive, and it's what I mean by invisible costs. When managers have to prepare presentations for corporate, attend committee meetings, and wait for approvals, several things happen. First, they spend time on internal politics rather than serving customers and beating competitors. Second, they start making decisions based on what will play well at headquarters rather than what's right for the business. Third, and most damaging, the best managers—the ones with true entrepreneurial spirit—become frustrated and either leave or mentally check out.\n\nWe've seen this owner-oriented attitude in action across our businesses, and it's invaluable. When there's a problem or opportunity, our managers act immediately. They don't wait for the quarterly budget review or form a committee to study it. This speed and decisiveness creates enormous value over time, even if it occasionally leads to a decision Charlie and I wouldn't have made.\n\nNow, are there costs to our approach? Absolutely. We explicitly acknowledge that we're sometimes late spotting management problems. Occasionally, capital gets allocated in ways we wouldn't have chosen. These are real costs, and they're visible when they occur. But here's the key insight: these visible costs are actually quite small compared to the invisible costs of bureaucracy.\n\nThink about it this way. If one of our managers makes a bad acquisition or investment, we can see it and quantify it. Maybe it costs us $50 million or even $100 million. That's real money, but it's a one-time hit. Now compare that to the cumulative cost of having hundreds of talented managers operating at 80% effectiveness because they're bogged down in corporate processes. Or the cost of losing our best managers to frustration. Or the cost of missed opportunities because decisions moved too slowly. These costs are invisible—they don't show up on any financial statement—but they're absolutely massive over time.\n\nOur approach also sends a powerful signal about the kind of company we are. When we acquire a business, the managers know we're not going to swoop in and change everything. We're not going to impose Berkshire systems or Berkshire culture. This makes us the buyer of choice for many entrepreneurs who've built valuable businesses and want to see them continue thriving. That's a competitive advantage worth far more than the cost of occasional mistakes."

The economy and the stock market are two different things, and confusing them is one of the biggest mistakes investors make.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When I said the economy would be in shambles throughout 2009 and probably beyond, I was making an observation about GDP, employment, housing, and all the real economic activity you can measure. And I was right – the economy was terrible. But here's what people miss: the stock market isn't the economy. The stock market is a forward-looking mechanism that's trying to price in future business values. It's looking out twelve months, eighteen months, sometimes years ahead.\n\nThink about what happened. We released that letter when the Dow was at 7,063. By year-end it was at 10,428 – that's a 48% gain. The economy was still struggling, unemployment was still high, but the market had moved on. Why? Because the market had already priced in the terrible economy. In fact, it had overpriced it. Stocks had gotten so cheap that they were discounting not just a bad economy, but perhaps the end of capitalism as we know it.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I never make market predictions. We can observe that the economy is in trouble – that's just looking at the facts in front of us. But translating that into a market call requires knowing what's already baked into prices, what other investors are thinking, what the psychology of the market is. That's a fool's game. I've been around for eight decades and I've never met anyone who could consistently predict short-term market movements.\n\nThe media's butchering of that sentence was terrible journalism because it turned an economic observation into an apparent market forecast, which is exactly what we weren't making. And investors who believed the sensationalized version and sold their stocks or stayed on the sidelines missed out on enormous gains. That's real money lost because of sloppy reporting.\n\nHere's what this teaches us: You need to separate facts from predictions, and economic conditions from market valuations. I can tell you that businesses will earn less money in a recession – that's just arithmetic. But I cannot tell you whether stocks will go up or down, because I don't know how much bad news is already reflected in current prices. Sometimes stocks go up in terrible economies because they're discounting something even worse that doesn't materialize. Sometimes they go down in good economies because they've gotten ahead of themselves.\n\nThis is why we focus on buying good businesses at sensible prices and holding them for the long term. We don't need to predict the market or the economy. We just need to understand business value. If we buy a dollar's worth of value for fifty cents, eventually the market will recognize that value, whether the economy is booming or busting. The specific path and timing? That's unknowable, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either confused or trying to sell you something."

        "value": "Insurance float is one of the most beautiful business models I've ever encountered, and understanding it is key to understanding Berkshire's success. Let me take you through this step by step, because it's worth really grasping.\n\nThe basic model works like this: customers pay us premiums today, and we pay claims later – sometimes much later. In workers' compensation, we might be paying claims for decades. In the meantime, we're holding onto that money, and we get to invest it. That pile of money we're holding is the float. For Berkshire, we're holding billions of dollars that technically belongs to others, but we get to invest it for our benefit until claims come due.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting. If we're good at underwriting – meaning we charge enough in premiums to cover our expenses and claims – we actually make an underwriting profit. So we're not just getting to use the money for free; we're getting paid to hold it. Imagine someone giving you a billion dollars, paying you a fee to take it, and letting you keep all the investment income you generate from it. That's the insurance business when it's done right.\n\nLet me give you the math to make this concrete. We carry our insurance companies on our books at $15.5 billion more than their tangible assets – that's the goodwill number. But they're worth far more than that because of this float dynamic. As our insurance business grows and we write more premiums, our float grows proportionally. It's remarkably stable. So we have this growing pool of money that we can invest in stocks, bonds, and even whole businesses.\n\nThe catch – and there's always a catch – is that this beautiful model attracts ferocious competition. Everyone wants free money. So the industry as a whole usually operates at an underwriting loss. Most insurers are essentially paying for the privilege of holding float. They lose money on their underwriting but hope to make it back through investment income. In catastrophe years, the underwriting losses can be so severe that they eat up all the investment income and then some.\n\nThis is where Berkshire's advantage comes in. We've been disciplined about underwriting. We're willing to shrink our business rather than write policies at inadequate prices. Many years we've achieved an underwriting profit, which means our cost of float has been negative – we've been paid to hold it. Even in years when we have an underwriting loss, our cost of float has typically been lower than the cost of borrowing money elsewhere.\n\nThink about what this means over decades. We've had this growing pool of low-cost or no-cost money that we've invested at reasonable rates of return. The compounding effect has been extraordinary. It's like running a business where your capital costs nothing or less than nothing. Every dollar of investment return flows through to our benefit.\n\nThe insurance business also has another advantage: it's tax-advantaged. We get to invest the float before taxes, and we only pay taxes on our investment gains. This gives us more capital to compound than if we were using borrowed money or equity capital that had already been taxed.\n\nThis is why I say insurance has been the engine of Berkshire's growth. It's provided us with permanent, low-cost capital that has funded our investments in everything from Coca-Cola to See's Candies to BNSF Railway. Without that float, Berkshire would be a fraction of its current size. It's not just a good business – it's been the foundation of everything else we've built."

And that changes everything about what you can do with your money.\n\nIn the early days at Berkshire, Charlie and I were working with limited capital. When you've got a small pot of money, you need to make every dollar work as hard as possible. The beautiful businesses – and they're still the most beautiful – are the ones that can grow without needing much capital. Think of something like See's Candies. We bought it for $25 million, and it just throws off cash year after year. We can take that cash and deploy it elsewhere. Those businesses have high returns on capital because the denominator stays small while the numerator keeps growing. You raise prices a little, you sell a little more, and you don't need to build new factories or buy expensive equipment. That's a dream situation.\n\nBut here's the problem we face today: Berkshire generates billions and billions of dollars every year. It's a high-class problem, but it's still a problem. We need to find places to intelligently deploy enormous sums of capital. The number of businesses that can absorb, say, ten billion dollars and give you wonderful returns without needing ongoing investment – well, you can count them on your fingers, and they rarely come up for sale at sensible prices.\n\nSo we've adapted our thinking. We're now willing to invest in businesses that require continuous capital expenditures, provided they meet certain criteria. First, they need to earn decent returns on that incremental capital – not spectacular, but reasonable. Second, and this is crucial, they need to provide essential services that aren't going away. BNSF and our utilities fit this perfectly. America needs railroads. America needs electricity. These aren't discretionary services that might be disrupted by the next app or technology. They're fundamental to economic activity.\n\nWhen we invest tens of billions into these businesses, we know we'll need to keep investing tens of billions more over time. The depreciation charges don't cover the real cost of maintaining and expanding these systems. But if we can earn, say, 10% on that capital in a world of low interest rates, and if we can keep deploying more and more capital at those rates, we're building something substantial and durable.\n\nThe key insight is this: when you're managing $500 billion in shareholders' capital, you can't just sit around waiting for perfect opportunities. You need to be realistic about what's available at scale. A business that earns 12% on ever-increasing amounts of capital, even if it requires constant reinvestment, is far better than earning 0% on cash or 2% on bonds. And it's certainly better than doing something stupid just because you're impatient.\n\nWe're not settling for mediocrity – we're being pragmatic about deploying massive amounts of capital in a way that will compound shareholders' wealth over decades. The math works, the businesses are essential, and we can invest at a scale that matches our needs. That's why we've changed our approach."

Let me explain why this matters so much.\n\nThese aren't normal businesses where you can just charge whatever the market will bear. We have a monopoly or near-monopoly in the territories we serve. If you're a factory in Wyoming and you need to ship goods by rail, you're using BNSF. You don't have five competitors to choose from. If you're a homeowner in Iowa and you need electricity, you're buying from MidAmerican Energy. That's just how it works – it would be economically insane to have three competing sets of railroad tracks or five different electrical grids running down the same street.\n\nNow, because we have this monopoly position, society has every right to regulate what we charge. Otherwise, we could gouge our customers mercilessly. So regulators step in and say, \"Here's what you can charge, and here's the return you can earn on your invested capital.\" That's the public's protection against monopoly abuse.\n\nBut here's the other side of the compact, and it's equally important: if regulators want us to invest the massive sums needed to maintain, expand, and improve these systems, they need to allow us a fair return. We're talking about tens of billions of dollars of investment. We'll only make those investments if we're confident we'll earn a reasonable return. If regulators get too aggressive and cut our allowed returns to the bone, we'll stop investing. We won't expand capacity. We won't upgrade systems. We'll do the bare minimum. And then everyone suffers – the public gets deteriorating service, economic growth slows, and the whole system breaks down.\n\nThis is why I use the word \"compact.\" Both sides have obligations. We must provide reliable, efficient service and invest continuously in our systems. We must not abuse our monopoly position. In return, regulators must allow us returns that make those investments worthwhile. They must provide certainty so we can plan decades ahead, because these aren't businesses where you can change direction quickly.\n\nWhat gives me confidence this will work? Simple: both sides need each other. America cannot reach its economic potential without first-class infrastructure. That's not debatable. You can't run a modern economy on a crumbling railroad system or an unreliable electrical grid. Politicians and regulators understand this. They might not always love utilities and railroads, but they know these services are essential.\n\nSimilarly, we need the public's acceptance and reasonable regulation. We can't operate these businesses in a hostile regulatory environment. We need stability and predictability. So we have every incentive to be good actors – to invest wisely, to provide excellent service, and to work constructively with regulators.\n\nI've watched regulated industries for over sixty years now, and while there are certainly bumps along the way, the system generally works. Reasonable people on both sides recognize their mutual dependence. We'll keep investing those tens of billions because we trust that we'll be allowed to earn appropriate returns. And regulators will keep allowing those returns because they know America needs the infrastructure we're building. It's not a perfect system, but it's a workable one, and that's what matters for the long haul."

When Dave Sokol and I and our families fly on NetJets under the exact same terms as every other customer – no special planes, no special crews, paying the same prices – we're doing something that goes far beyond a nice gesture. We're creating the most powerful quality control mechanism that exists in business.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. When management uses their own products and services under identical conditions as customers, they experience every flaw, every shortcoming, every moment of excellence or mediocrity. There's no hiding from reality. If safety standards slip even slightly, my family is at risk. If service quality deteriorates, I experience the frustration personally. If pricing becomes unfair, I'm writing the same inflated checks as everyone else. This creates an alignment of interests that no amount of customer surveys, quality reports, or management meetings can replicate.\n\nThe aviation business makes this principle even more critical because we're talking about safety – literally life and death. Rich Santulli built NetJets on top-of-the-line safety standards, and when Dave took over, we both understood that these standards were non-negotiable. Now, I could simply mandate that safety remains paramount and hope that management follows through. But hope isn't a strategy. Instead, by putting myself and my family on those planes under standard conditions, I've made absolutely certain that I'll know immediately if standards slip, and I've given myself the strongest possible personal motivation to ensure they never do.\n\nThis principle extends well beyond aviation. Throughout Berkshire, I look for situations where management has skin in the game – where they benefit when shareholders benefit and suffer when shareholders suffer. It's why I've always believed that managers should have significant personal wealth invested in their businesses. It's why I'm skeptical of compensation systems that reward managers regardless of actual performance. And it's why I pay attention to whether CEOs actually use and believe in their own products.\n\nThe testimonial value is also significant. When customers know that the owner flies on the same planes, under the same conditions, paying the same prices, it sends an unmistakable message about quality and fairness. Actions speak louder than words. Anyone can claim their product is the best or safest. But when you're willing to stake your own life and your family's lives on that claim, people pay attention. That's a testimonial that can't be faked or manufactured by a marketing department.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about authenticity in business. Companies that truly believe in their products demonstrate it through their actions, not their advertising. When management eats their own cooking, it creates a natural check on quality, a powerful incentive structure, and a credible signal to customers. It's one of the simplest yet most effective ways to ensure that a business maintains high standards over time, which is exactly what we saw happen at NetJets under Dave's leadership."

        "value": "The housing situation perfectly illustrates a fundamental economic principle that people often forget during boom times: supply and demand must eventually balance, and the longer an imbalance persists, the more painful the correction becomes. Let me walk you through the logic of what happened and why the correction, while painful, was absolutely necessary.\n\nFor several years leading up to the crisis, we were building about two million housing units annually while household formations – the actual demand – only amounted to about 1.2 million. Now, you don't need an economics degree to understand what happens when you produce 800,000 more units each year than you need. After just a few years of this imbalance, the country ended up with a massive overhang of excess housing. This wasn't sustainable, and the market had to correct.\n\nI outlined three theoretical ways to cure this overhang, and while I was being somewhat facetious with the first two, they illustrate an important point. You could blow up houses, similar to cash-for-clunkers, but that's economically wasteful. You could artificially stimulate household formations, but you can't force demographic trends. The only realistic solution was option three: reduce new housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations until the excess inventory gets absorbed. That's exactly what happened when starts fell to 554,000 in 2009, the lowest in fifty years.\n\nNow here's what's crucial to understand: this dramatic reduction in housing starts, while devastating for homebuilders and construction workers in the short term, was actually good news for the economy's long-term health. The paradox is that what looked like terrible news – historically low housing starts – was actually the medicine the patient needed. By building far fewer homes than the rate of household formation, we were finally working off that excess inventory.\n\nThis correction process teaches us several important lessons about markets. First, imbalances don't persist forever. When supply exceeds demand for an extended period, prices must fall and production must decline until equilibrium is restored. No amount of government intervention or wishful thinking can permanently override this basic economic reality. Second, the longer an imbalance builds, the more severe the correction. If we'd recognized the oversupply problem earlier and made smaller adjustments, the crash wouldn't have been so dramatic.\n\nThird, and this is critical, corrections create winners and losers, but they don't destroy value in aggregate – they redistribute it. For every seller or lender hurt by falling prices, there's a buyer who benefits. Many families that couldn't afford an appropriate home during the bubble suddenly found homeownership well within their means. The wealth didn't disappear; it shifted from sellers to buyers, from lenders to borrowers who could refinance or purchase at lower prices.\n\nThis is why I said the country wisely selected the third option. By allowing housing starts to fall dramatically rather than propping them up artificially, we enabled the market to clear. Within a year or so of that writing, I expected residential housing problems to be largely behind us, except in areas where overbuilding was particularly egregious or in the high-value segment. The market was healing itself through the natural mechanism of reduced supply meeting steady demand.\n\nThe broader investment lesson is to respect supply and demand fundamentals. When you see production consistently exceeding consumption in any industry, you should expect a correction. The housing crisis wasn't some unpredictable black swan – it was the inevitable result of building far more houses than we needed for years on end."

When we report a $1.5 billion loss one quarter and then a $2.4 billion gain the next, as we did in 2009, nothing fundamental has changed about the underlying value of our business or our cash position. These are simply mark-to-market accounting entries that reflect what someone might theoretically pay for these contracts at a particular moment in time.\n\nLet me explain why Charlie and I don't get excited or depressed by these swings. We entered into these derivatives contracts because we believed they were mispriced in our favor. We're getting paid float – money we can invest – and we expect to profit over the life of these contracts. The quarterly valuations are just noise along the way. It's like owning a wonderful business that temporarily gets marked down in price during a market panic. The business hasn't changed, just the quote.\n\nThink about it this way: if you own a farm or an apartment building, nobody comes by every three months to give you a mark-to-market valuation that swings wildly based on current market sentiment. You judge your investment based on what it produces over time. That's exactly how we think about our derivatives portfolio. We care about the cash we receive upfront as float, the investment income we earn on that float, and the ultimate settlement value when the contracts expire. The marks in between are just scorekeeping that doesn't affect our ability to deploy capital or run our businesses.\n\nThis is why we separate out these figures when we report to shareholders. We want you to see clearly what our operating businesses are actually earning. If we just gave you one big GAAP earnings number, it would be almost meaningless for understanding Berkshire's performance. One quarter we'd look like geniuses, the next quarter like fools, when in reality nothing of substance had changed.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about focusing on what truly matters in business valuation. Reported earnings under GAAP are important, but they're not the same thing as economic earnings or intrinsic value creation. A good investor needs to look through the accounting conventions and understand what's really happening to the cash-generating ability of the business. \n\nThis applies beyond derivatives too. When we have unrealized gains or losses in our stock portfolio, those also swing around quarter to quarter based on market prices. But if we own wonderful businesses at good prices, temporary market fluctuations are opportunities, not threats. The worst thing an investor can do is confuse volatility in reported numbers with actual economic loss. That confusion leads to panic selling at exactly the wrong time.\n\nWhat shareholders should take away is this: focus on the fundamentals of what we own and how our businesses are performing operationally. The derivatives float is valuable to us. We're earning good returns on it. The quarterly marks will bounce around, but that's not what determines whether we made a good decision. Time will tell that story, not quarterly accounting entries."

That's why I personally initiate and monitor every derivatives contract on Berkshire's books, except for a few operational ones at subsidiaries. This isn't something I can hand off to a Chief Risk Officer or a committee. The buck stops with me, and if Berkshire ever gets in trouble from derivatives, it will be my fault, period.\n\nLet me tell you why delegation fails in risk control. First, the CEO is the only person who sees the entire picture of the organization. Risk isn't just about individual positions – it's about how everything interacts, about correlation and concentration and counterparty exposure across the whole enterprise. A risk officer in a silo can't possibly understand all these connections the way a CEO should. Second, and this is crucial, only the CEO has the authority to say no to the profit-seeking parts of the organization. When a trading desk is making huge profits on risky positions, who's going to shut it down? Not a risk committee that the traders can circumvent or outvote. It takes someone with ultimate authority and responsibility.\n\nWhat happened at the major financial institutions is a case study in what not to do. These organizations allowed extreme leverage to build up in their systems. They took on massive counterparty risk, often not even understanding who was on the other side of their trades or whether those counterparties could pay. They created derivatives positions so complex and interconnected that when trouble came, it cascaded through the entire system. And critically, the CEOs of these institutions either didn't understand the risks they were taking or chose to ignore them because the profits looked so good.\n\nHere's what really bothers me about those failures: it wasn't the shareholders who made these disastrous decisions. The shareholders didn't tell management to lever up thirty or forty to one. They didn't instruct them to fill their balance sheets with toxic mortgage securities or to write billions in credit default swaps without proper collateral. Yet shareholders bore almost the entire burden, with ninety percent or more of their investment value wiped out. Over five hundred billion dollars of shareholder wealth destroyed in just four institutions in two years.\n\nMeanwhile, what happened to the CEOs and boards who presided over these disasters? In most cases, they walked away wealthy from years of inflated compensation based on illusory profits that were really just risk premiums they were collecting before the inevitable blowup. That's not capitalism working properly – that's a system with completely misaligned incentives.\n\nThis is why I believe boards of huge financial institutions are derelict if they don't insist their CEO take full responsibility for risk control. And if the government has to step in with funds or guarantees because of failure, the financial consequences for that CEO and board should be severe. Not just losing their jobs, but facing real financial pain themselves. Until we get those incentives right, we'll keep seeing the same pattern: heads I win with huge bonuses, tails the shareholders and taxpayers lose."

When 90% or more of your investment's value disappears, calling that a \"bailout\" makes absolutely no sense. These shareholders bore the real cost of failure.\n\nNow, let me explain what actually happened in these situations. When the government steps in to prevent a complete collapse of a financial institution, they're not doing it to protect the shareholders – they're doing it to protect the broader financial system, the depositors, the counterparties, and ultimately the economy. The shareholders still get crushed. Their equity gets diluted to nothing or near-nothing. They lose their investment. That's not a bailout by any reasonable definition of the word.\n\nThe real problem – and this is what gets my blood boiling – is that the CEOs and directors who caused these catastrophes walked away largely unscathed. Sure, maybe their net worth took a hit, but they're still living in grand style. They still have their mansions, their country club memberships, their comfortable retirements. They made decisions that destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value and put the entire financial system at risk, yet they faced no truly serious personal consequences.\n\nThis creates a terrible incentive structure. For years, we've operated under a system where CEOs get enormous upside through stock options, bonuses, and generous compensation packages – those are the carrots. But where are the sticks? If you're running a major financial institution and you know that reckless behavior might make you fabulously wealthy if things go well, but you'll still be fine if things go badly, what's to stop you from taking excessive risks? You're playing with other people's money, and you've got heads-I-win, tails-you-lose odds.\n\nWhat needs to change is simple: CEOs and directors need to face severe personal financial consequences when their recklessness damages their institutions and harms the country. And I don't mean consequences that can be reimbursed by the company or covered by insurance. I mean real, personal financial pain that comes out of their own pockets and can't be shifted to someone else. They need to have significant skin in the game that they can actually lose.\n\nThe principle here is straightforward – if you're going to enjoy the enormous rewards that come with running a major financial institution, you need to bear real downside risk too. We need meaningful sticks to go along with those oversized carrots. Until we change this dynamic, until we make it so that the people making the decisions actually suffer when those decisions go badly wrong, we're going to keep seeing the same reckless behavior repeated.

It makes no sense, yet companies do this all the time in stock-for-stock mergers, and their shareholders get hurt.\n\nLet me walk you through the mathematics with the example I gave, because this really illuminates the problem. Imagine Company A and Company B, both with businesses truly worth $100 per share in intrinsic value, but both stocks are trading at $80 per share in the market. Now, A's CEO wants to acquire B and offers 1.25 shares of A for each share of B. On the surface, this might look reasonable to B's shareholders – they're getting $100 worth of market value (1.25 times $80) for their shares.\n\nBut here's what's really happening: B's shareholders are giving up something worth $100 in intrinsic value, which is correct. However, A's shareholders are giving up 1.25 shares worth $100 each in intrinsic value – that's $125 in real value to acquire something worth $100. A's shareholders just destroyed $25 of value per share of B acquired. When you do the math on the combined company, B's shareholders end up owning 55.6% of the combined entity while A's shareholders own only 44.4%, even though both companies were equal in size and value to begin with.\n\nThis is wealth transfer, pure and simple. A's shareholders got taken to the cleaners. But here's the insidious part – not everyone at Company A loses. The CEO now runs a company twice as large as before. In the corporate world, compensation and prestige tend to correlate with size. So the CEO benefits personally even though he just destroyed shareholder value. His empire is bigger, his pay likely goes up, and he gets more respect in CEO circles. Meanwhile, his shareholders are worse off.\n\nThe key insight is understanding the difference between market price and intrinsic value. When your stock is trading below intrinsic value – which happens frequently – using it as currency in an acquisition is like paying with dollars worth more than a dollar. You're overpaying in real terms even if the market prices look fair. You simply cannot make a sensible all-stock deal when your shares are undervalued. The mathematics won't work in your shareholders' favor.\n\nNow, I mentioned that if an acquirer's stock is overvalued, it's a different story. If your stock is trading above intrinsic value, then using it as currency works to your advantage. You're paying with inflated dollars. But Charlie and I won't do that either, because we think about the people on the other side of the transaction. We want to treat the shareholders of companies we acquire the way we'd want to be treated.\n\nThis is why we made an exception with BNSF – we issued about 6.1% more shares, and believe me, we didn't enjoy it. But BNSF was such an extraordinary business at a fair price that even issuing stock made sense. That's a rare situation. The general principle remains: protect your shareholders by not diluting them with stock issuances unless you're absolutely certain you're creating, not destroying, value. Most CEOs don't think this way because their incentives are wrong, but that doesn't make it right."

Sometimes they're right about that part.\n\nBut here's where the intellectual dishonesty comes in. When the acquiring company is using its own stock as currency, these same bankers simply use the market price to value what's being given up. They'll say, \"We're issuing $1 billion worth of stock\" based purely on the current market price. Yet if someone were trying to acquire their client – the company doing the buying – these very same bankers would argue passionately that the market price dramatically undervalues the business. They'd say the stock is worth far more than the market recognizes.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. Either market prices are reliable indicators of value or they aren't. The bankers are essentially arguing that market prices are meaningless when valuing what you're buying, but perfectly accurate when valuing what you're selling. It's absurd on its face.\n\nWhy does this happen? Follow the money. Investment bankers get paid when deals close. Management gets paid through larger empires to run, which means more prestige and higher compensation. The CEO's domain doubles in size, and suddenly he's running a much bigger operation. Directors often go along because they don't want to appear obstructionist or unsophisticated. Everyone in the room has an incentive to get the deal done except the shareholders, who usually aren't in the room.\n\nThis is why I suggested that directors should hire a second advisor whose fee is contingent on the deal not going through. Now, I said that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but there's a serious point underneath. You need someone in that room whose job is to poke holes in the analysis, to argue the other side, to point out that the stock being issued might be worth far more than its market price suggests.\n\nIn our BNSF acquisition, Charlie and I were acutely aware that we were using stock we believed was worth more than its market value. We estimated that real cost, not just the market price. That's why the decision was close for us. We only went ahead because we'd previously bought a substantial position for cash, so only about 30% of the total cost was paid in stock we thought was undervalued. If we'd needed to use more stock, we would have walked away, because we would have been giving up more than we were getting.\n\nThe broader lesson is this: when you're using stock as currency, you must value it honestly. Anything else is just fooling yourself, even if everyone in the boardroom is nodding along."

        "value": "The counterfeit money phenomenon is one of the most insidious dynamics in financial markets, and it's caused enormous wealth transfers over the decades. Let me explain exactly how this works and why it's so destructive.\n\nWhen a company's stock becomes significantly overvalued – which happens regularly during bubbles in various sectors – management essentially has access to a printing press. They can issue shares at prices that bear no relationship to the underlying economic value of their business. If they're unscrupulous, or let's say \"sly\" as I put it in the text, they can use this overvalued paper to buy real assets or real businesses at what appears to be reasonable prices.\n\nHere's a concrete example of how it works. Suppose Company A has stock trading at ten times what it's really worth because investors have gotten caught up in some mania – maybe it's a tech bubble, or a conglomerate craze, or whatever the fashion of the moment happens to be. Company A can then offer its stock to acquire Company B, which is rationally priced. From Company B's shareholders' perspective, they're getting what looks like fair value based on market prices. But in reality, they're trading a dollar of real value for ten cents of real value, because Company A's stock is so inflated.\n\nThe promoters running Company A know exactly what they're doing. There's plenty of private snickering, as I mentioned, even though no one publicly acknowledges the game being played. They're essentially conducting a wealth transfer from the shareholders of the acquired companies to their own shareholders. And they can keep doing this repeatedly – serial acquisitions – as long as their stock stays overvalued.\n\nThe late 1960s was a particularly obscene period for this kind of behavior. Certain large conglomerates were built entirely through this method. They'd use inflated stock to buy real businesses, which would temporarily boost their earnings, which would keep their stock inflated, which would let them buy more businesses. It was a chain letter that eventually collapsed, as all chain letters do, but not before enormous wealth was transferred and some promoters became very rich.\n\nThis is why I said that when an acquirer's stock is overvalued, using it as currency works to the acquirer's advantage. It's the mirror image of our BNSF situation. We were using stock we thought was undervalued, which worked to our disadvantage. But if we'd had overvalued stock, we could have used it to our advantage – though Charlie and I would never do that because it's not how we want to treat our partners.\n\nThe broader danger to markets is that these bubble periods create terrible capital allocation. Real assets get transferred to companies run by promoters rather than to their best uses. Shareholders of acquired companies get taken advantage of, even though they think they're getting fair value. And when the bubble eventually bursts, the whole house of cards collapses.\n\nThe lesson for investors is to be extremely skeptical when companies with high-flying stocks start making acquisitions using their shares as currency. Ask yourself: would this deal make sense if they had to pay cash? If the answer is no, then they're probably using counterfeit money, and someone is getting taken advantage of. Make sure it's not you."

        "value": "The problem with advisors in acquisitions is fundamentally about incentive structures, and it's one of the most pernicious issues in corporate America. When you hire an investment banker to advise on an acquisition and their fee depends on the deal closing, you've created a situation where you're asking someone to be objective when their financial interest lies entirely on one side of the equation. It's human nature – these aren't bad people, but they're responding rationally to the incentives you've placed in front of them.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When a CEO or board is contemplating an acquisition using stock as currency, they need clear-headed analysis about whether the deal makes sense. They need someone to challenge their assumptions, to point out the flaws, to ask the hard questions. But if your advisor only gets paid when the deal happens, what do you think their advice will be? They'll find reasons why the deal works. They'll massage the numbers. They'll tell you about \"strategic synergies\" and being \"in the hunt\" and not missing opportunities. It's completely predictable.\n\nThat's why I say, \"Don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\" The barber's interest is in cutting hair, not in giving you objective advice about your grooming needs. It's a simple analogy, but it captures a profound truth about human behavior. We all respond to incentives, and when someone's paycheck depends on them reaching a particular conclusion, that's very likely the conclusion they'll reach.\n\nNow, my suggestion about hiring a second advisor whose fee is contingent on the deal NOT going through might sound extreme, but think about what it accomplishes. Suddenly you have two smart people, both highly motivated, arguing opposite sides of the question. The board gets to hear the best case for doing the deal and the best case against it. That's how you get to rational decision-making. Without that balance, you're just getting a sales pitch dressed up as analysis.\n\nThe bank story I shared illustrates this perfectly. Here were fine people, able bankers who had run their institution well for years. But once they got the freedom to make acquisitions, they behaved like teenage boys discovering girls – they lost all sense of discipline and proportion. And I guarantee you their advisors were cheering them on, collecting their fees, and telling them this was all perfectly reasonable. The managers wanted to show they were \"in the hunt,\" as if making a bad deal was better than making no deal at all.\n\nThe tragedy is that this happens over and over again in corporate America. Managers get acquisition fever, advisors enable it because that's how they get paid, and shareholders suffer. The seller in our bank story understood this perfectly – he got three times book value in stock for his bank, then essentially told the acquirer, \"Don't ever be this stupid again.\" He knew it was a terrible deal for the buyer. Everyone knew it except the people who needed to know it most: the board and management who approved it.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: be deeply skeptical of advice when the advisor has a financial stake in one particular outcome, and structure your decision-making to get genuinely balanced perspectives."

        "value": "Charlie's comment cuts right to the heart of one of the most common and dangerous rationalizations in corporate management. When those bank managers said \"it's only a small deal,\" they were essentially arguing that modest harm to shareholders wasn't worth worrying about. Charlie's response – asking if we're supposed to applaud because the dog fouling our lawn is small rather than large – exposes the absurdity of this thinking. Harm is harm, and the size doesn't make it acceptable.\n\nLet me explain why this rationalization is so insidious. When managers make a bad acquisition, they often defend it by pointing to its relative size compared to the overall company. \"It's only 2% of our market cap,\" they'll say, or \"Even if it doesn't work out, it won't move the needle much.\" This completely misses the point. First, shareholders' money is being destroyed – it doesn't matter whether it's a little bit or a lot. Would you be happy if I took $100 from your wallet just because you have $10,000 in the bank? Second, and perhaps more importantly, these small bad deals reveal a management mindset that will eventually lead to large bad deals.\n\nThe bank story demonstrates this progression perfectly. Management had been \"statutorily prevented from acquisitions\" for decades. The moment that constraint was removed, they immediately started looking for deals. They weren't responding to a specific opportunity that made strategic sense; they were responding to the newly available option to do deals. That's backwards thinking. You should make acquisitions when you find something that creates value, not because you have the ability to make acquisitions.\n\nThen came the rationalizations. They paid nearly three times book value for a bank that had similar financial characteristics to their own bank, which was trading near book value. Think about that for a moment. They were saying their own stock was worth one dollar, but they'd pay three dollars for someone else's essentially identical business. That's value destruction, pure and simple. They gave away three dollars of their shareholders' money to acquire one dollar of value.\n\nBut here's what really matters: the \"it's only a small deal\" excuse reveals that management had already abandoned rational decision-making. If you're willing to make a bad deal because it's small, what happens when you get comfortable with acquisitions? What happens when you want to make a splash, or when you feel pressure to deploy capital, or when you're competing with other banks for a larger target? You make the same bad decisions, just with more zeros attached.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I pay so much attention to how managers think about capital allocation. The bank managers in this story were \"fine people and able bankers\" in their core business. But when it came to acquisitions, they lost their discipline. They wanted to show they were players. They wanted to be in the hunt. These are emotional motivations, not rational business reasons.\n\nThe ultimate irony, of course, is that the seller recognized what a bad deal it was. His demand that the acquiring bank promise never to do another deal this dumb was his way of protecting his new investment in their stock. He knew he'd gotten the better end of the bargain, and he didn't want his gains diluted by future stupidity. Meanwhile, the acquiring bank's managers lived happily ever after – they got a bigger empire to run, they got to feel like dealmakers, and they faced no consequences for destroying shareholder value.\n\nThe lesson is clear: never accept \"it's only small\" as justification for a bad decision, because small bad decisions reveal thinking that leads to large bad decisions."
