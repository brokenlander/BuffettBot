        "value": "The pro-forma earnings game represents one of the most insidious forms of corporate dishonesty, and I wanted to shine a light on it by doing exactly the opposite of what most managers do. When CEOs present pro-forma earnings, they're essentially asking shareholders to ignore reality and focus only on a prettied-up version of results. They say \"don't count this charge, don't count that write-off – just look at what we would have earned if all these bad things hadn't happened.\" The problem is that these bad things did happen, and they happened on management's watch, using shareholders' capital.\n\nWhat really gets me is the one-way nature of these adjustments. I've been reading annual reports for over seventy years, and I have yet to see a single pro-forma presentation where management said \"You know, our audited earnings were actually a bit high – let us show you what we really earned.\" It's always in the direction of making things look better. Year after year, companies exclude \"unusual\" charges, and somehow these unusual items show up with remarkable regularity. If something happens every year or two, it's not unusual – it's part of doing business.\n\nIn the insurance industry, this practice is particularly egregious. When there's a major hurricane or earthquake, insurers love to report what they would have earned \"except for\" the catastrophe. The implication is clear: don't hold this against us because big disasters are rare and unpredictable. But here's the thing – catastrophes are exactly what insurance companies are in business to cover. Saying you would have had great earnings except for having to pay insurance claims is like a grocery store saying they would have had wonderful profits except for the cost of the merchandise they sold. Those \"except for\" losses are the very essence of the insurance business. We collect premiums every year specifically because we're promising to be there when disaster strikes.\n\nSo when we had a year without a mega-catastrophe in 2002, I thought it was important to do the reverse calculation. Our reported earnings benefited from not having a major disaster and from some favorable bond market conditions that helped our finance business. These were tailwinds that wouldn't persist. To give shareholders an honest picture, I needed to point out that our \"normalized\" earnings – the kind of earnings power they should expect going forward – were actually about $500 million lower than what we reported.\n\nThis is what intellectual honesty looks like. It's not about making yourself look good in every quarterly report. It's about giving your partners – and that's what our shareholders are – a clear-eyed view of the business. If managers only make pro-forma adjustments that inflate earnings, they're not being honest brokers of information. They're salesmen putting lipstick on a pig. Charlie and I believe that if you're going to adjust earnings to show underlying reality, you need to do it in both directions. Otherwise, you're just playing games with numbers, and that destroys the trust between management and owners."

        "value": "The decline in our common stock allocation wasn't a market-timing decision or some grand strategic shift – it was simply a response to what we were finding, or more accurately, not finding in the marketplace. Charlie and I don't sit around deciding what percentage of Berkshire's assets should be in stocks versus bonds versus cash. Instead, we look at what's available and ask ourselves a simple question: does this investment make sense at today's price? When we find things that meet our standards, we buy them. When we don't, we don't. It's that straightforward.\n\nWhat happened over the years leading up to 2002 was that common stocks became increasingly expensive relative to their intrinsic value. During the late 1990s bubble, prices got completely disconnected from business reality. We weren't finding many – or really any – stocks that made sense at prevailing prices. Meanwhile, we were generating enormous amounts of cash from our operating businesses, particularly our insurance operations. That cash had to go somewhere. We weren't going to buy overpriced stocks just to stay fully invested, so the cash accumulated, and when we did deploy capital, it increasingly went into other areas – businesses we could buy in their entirety, bonds, and other instruments that offered better value.\n\nThis shift in asset allocation has important consequences that I wanted shareholders to understand. In a roaring bull market, when stock prices are climbing 20% or 30% a year, Berkshire will lag behind. If we've got 30% of our assets in common stocks and the market is up 25%, while someone else has 70% in stocks, the math works against us. We'll underperform, and possibly by a significant margin. That's just arithmetic. Shareholders need to understand this going in, because otherwise they'll be disappointed and wonder what we're doing wrong.\n\nConversely, in down markets or flat markets, our lower stock allocation becomes an advantage. In 2002, when the S&P was down significantly, we didn't have as much capital exposed to those losses. Our insurance businesses, our wholly-owned operating companies, and our cash positions provided ballast. This is why we outperformed by such a wide margin that year – 32.1 percentage points. But I wanted to be crystal clear that this was aberrational. It's not something shareholders should expect regularly.\n\nThe deeper principle here is about intellectual honesty and managing expectations. We're not going to change our approach to chase performance in bull markets. We're not going to buy stocks we don't understand or that don't offer adequate value just to keep up with an index. If that means we lag during periods of market euphoria, so be it. Our job is to compound Berkshire's intrinsic value over long periods at a reasonable rate, not to match the S&P every quarter or every year.\n\nWhat I'm really telling shareholders is this: judge us over periods of five, ten, or twenty years, not year to year. Understand that our results will be lumpy and that our asset allocation will shift based on opportunity, not based on some predetermined formula. When stocks are cheap, we'll own more of them. When they're expensive, we'll own less. This means our relative performance will vary considerably depending on market conditions. But over time, this approach of only swinging at fat pitches should serve our shareholders well."

        "value": "The Eddie Bennett story illustrates what I consider the most important principle in management: your job as a manager isn't to make average people perform better through constant supervision and intervention. Your job is to find extraordinary people and then be smart enough not to mess them up. Eddie didn't win all those pennants because he had superior bat-lugging technique. He won because he understood that his success depended entirely on associating with winners like Ruth and Gehrig, not on perfecting his own craft.\n\nThis philosophy runs completely counter to what they teach in business schools and what most corporate executives practice. The typical CEO thinks their value comes from making decisions, reorganizing divisions, implementing new strategies, and generally staying busy looking important. They believe that management is an active verb. But I've learned that in most cases, that kind of interference destroys value rather than creating it.\n\nThink about what we've built at Berkshire. We have managers running businesses as if they own them, because in many cases they did own them before selling to us. Steve McKenzie at Albecca and John Holland at Fruit of the Loom don't need me telling them how to run their operations. John literally rescued Fruit of the Loom from disaster after he'd retired. What could I possibly teach him about the underwear business? The man knows more about producing and selling underwear than I'll ever know.\n\nThe key insight is that great managers are self-motivated. They have what I call an inner scorecard. They're not working for the money—as I mentioned, many of our managers have no financial need to work at all. They're working because they love the game, they take pride in their craft, and they want to build something excellent. When you have people like that, your job is simple: give them capital when they need it, get them whatever resources they require, and then get out of the way.\n\nThe traditional corporate model does the opposite. It layers on bureaucracy, requires endless reports and meetings, rotates managers between divisions to give them \"broader experience,\" and generally treats talented people like interchangeable parts. That's why in 38 years, we've never had a single CEO leave Berkshire to work elsewhere. They stay because we let them run their businesses.\n\nMy role is capital allocation, not operations. Our operating CEOs generate cash, and I decide where to deploy it. That's a job that benefits from centralization because I can see across all our businesses and find the best opportunities. But the actual running of a custom picture frame business or an underwear company? That requires specific expertise and daily attention to detail that I don't have and don't need to have.\n\nThe Eddie Bennett model works because it's built on a foundation of humility and clear thinking. I know what I'm good at, and I know what I'm not good at. I'm good at evaluating businesses and allocating capital. I'm not good at managing the day-to-day operations of 70-plus different businesses across dozens of industries. So I don't try. I find people who are masters of their crafts, and I hand them the bat."

We benefited from about $500 million in favorable breaks that year—things that went our way through luck rather than skill. I could have buried that fact in the footnotes or ignored it entirely. Most CEOs would have. But I think shareholders deserve to know the difference between what we earned through good decisions and what fell into our laps through good fortune.\n\nThis matters because one of the biggest problems in corporate America is the way executives talk about results. When things go well, it's always because of brilliant strategy and flawless execution. When things go poorly, it's always because of unexpected headwinds, market conditions, or other factors beyond management's control. This is nonsense, and everyone knows it's nonsense, but we all play along with the charade.\n\nThe truth is that business results in any given year are a mixture of skill, luck, timing, and circumstances beyond anyone's control. Sometimes you make great decisions and get poor results. Sometimes you make mediocre decisions and get great results. The key is being honest about which is which, both with yourself and with your shareholders.\n\nI use the Jack Benny joke because it perfectly captures the absurdity of taking credit for things you didn't earn while complaining about things you didn't deserve. Benny's saying: \"Look, I'm happy to accept this award even though I know I didn't really deserve it. But if I'm being consistent, I also have to accept the arthritis I didn't deserve.\" It's a reminder that you can't have it both ways. You can't claim credit for every good thing while disclaiming responsibility for every bad thing.\n\nThis intellectual honesty serves several purposes. First, it helps me think clearly about our actual performance. If I convince myself that $500 million in lucky breaks was actually the result of my brilliant capital allocation, I'm going to make worse decisions going forward. I'll overestimate my abilities and take inappropriate risks. Honest self-assessment is essential to good decision-making.\n\nSecond, it builds trust with shareholders. Our investors aren't stupid. They can see through the usual corporate double-talk. When I tell them straight out that we got lucky, they know they're getting the real story. That credibility is valuable. It means when I tell them something good happened because we made smart decisions, they believe me.\n\nThird, it sets the right tone for our entire organization. If I'm honest about luck and skill at the top, it encourages that same honesty throughout Berkshire. Our managers know they don't need to spin their results or make excuses. They can just tell me what happened and why.\n\nThe \"happy to bank the excess\" part is important too. I'm not going to send the money back or apologize for being lucky. In investing and business, you take what the market gives you. Some years you'll get more than you deserve, some years less. Over time, if you make good decisions consistently, the skill component will dominate. But in any single year, luck can overwhelm skill in either direction.\n\nThis connects to how we think about long-term performance. I don't get too excited about one great year, and I don't get too depressed about one poor year. I'm trying to build a machine that produces good results over decades, not quarters. That requires seeing through the noise of short-term luck to understand the underlying quality of our decisions and operations. You can't do that if you're not honest about when you got lucky and when you got unlucky."

        "value": "You describe float as either valuable or a \"lemon\" depending on its cost relative to market rates for money. Can you explain why the declining interest rate environment makes this distinction so much more critical, and what this teaches us about evaluating insurance businesses?"

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The relationship between float cost and interest rates is absolutely fundamental to understanding insurance economics, and it's something that's become increasingly important as rates have declined over the years. Let me walk you through why this matters so much.\n\nFirst, understand what we're really doing in the insurance business. We're collecting premiums upfront, and we get to hold and invest that money until we pay claims, which might be years down the road. That's our float. Now, if we underwrite poorly and lose, say, five cents on every premium dollar, our float costs us 5%. The question then becomes: Is that 5% cost acceptable? Well, it depends entirely on what else is happening in the financial world.\n\nBack when interest rates were higher, let's say 10% or 12%, an insurance company losing 5% on underwriting could still make excellent money. You'd lose that 5% on underwriting, but you'd earn 10% or 12% investing the float, netting you a nice profit of 5% to 7% on funds that aren't even yours. The math worked beautifully, and it made a lot of insurance executives look smarter than they actually were.\n\nBut here's where the declining rate environment changes everything. When rates drop to 3% or 4%, suddenly that same 5% underwriting loss means you're losing money overall. You're paying 5% for the privilege of holding money that only earns you 3%. That's a recipe for destroying value, not creating it. The insurance business that looked brilliant at higher rates has transformed into what I call a lemon.\n\nThis is why I emphasize that there's nothing automatic about cheap float. You can't just assume that because you're in the insurance business, you're going to make money. The discipline required to underwrite profitably becomes more critical as rates decline, because the margin for error shrinks dramatically.\n\nLook at our own experience. In 2001, our float cost was a terrible 12.8%, partly due to World Trade Center losses. That's painful in any rate environment, but it's absolutely devastating when you can only earn low single digits on your investments. We've also had years where our float cost was less than zero—we were actually paid to hold other people's money. That's the gold standard, and it's what we're always shooting for.\n\nThe lesson here is profound: you must evaluate insurance businesses based on their underwriting discipline, not just their size or market share. An insurance company that consistently loses money on underwriting is destroying value unless it can invest at rates high enough to overcome those losses. As rates have come down, that's become nearly impossible for undisciplined underwriters.\n\nThis is why we focus so intensely on the three principles I mentioned: unwavering underwriting discipline, conservative reserving, and avoiding dangerous aggregations of risk. These aren't just nice-to-have qualities; they're essential to generating low-cost or no-cost float. Without them, you're running a lemon factory, and no amount of investment skill can save you when you're paying too much for your raw material—which in this business is float."

        "value": "This tension between growth and discipline is one of the most important challenges in the insurance business, and frankly, it's where most insurance companies go wrong. Let me explain how we think about this at Berkshire, because it goes to the heart of our business philosophy.\n\nThe first thing you need to understand is that float is only valuable if it comes at the right price. I'd rather have $1 billion of float at zero cost than $10 billion of float that costs me 10%. Too many insurance executives get seduced by size and market share, thinking that getting bigger is always better. It's not. Getting bigger while writing unprofitable business is a guaranteed way to destroy shareholder value.\n\nNow, look at our float growth over the years. We went from $20 million in 1967 to over $41 billion by 2002. That's extraordinary growth, but notice something important: it wasn't steady or predictable. We grew opportunistically, not mechanically. When pricing was good and we could write profitable business, we wrote a lot of it. When pricing deteriorated and competitors were being irrational, we pulled back. This requires patience and discipline that most managements simply don't have.\n\nHere's why that discipline is so hard to maintain: insurance is a business where you don't know your actual costs for years. When you write a policy today, you're making an estimate about what claims will cost down the road. If you're optimistic in your estimates—or if you just want to write more business to keep your employees busy and your market share up—you can fool yourself into thinking you're making money when you're actually losing it. The bill doesn't come due until later, sometimes much later.\n\nThis is where the pressure really builds. Your competitors are out there writing business at prices you think are inadequate. Your sales force is complaining that they're losing deals. Your employees are worried about their jobs if volume drops. Wall Street analysts are questioning why your market share is declining. The pressure to compromise, to write business at inadequate rates \"just this once,\" becomes enormous.\n\nBut here's what we've learned over 36 years: the discipline to say no is what separates valuable insurance franchises from value destroyers. When we see competitors writing business at prices that don't make sense, we don't match them. We shrink if we have to. Our managers know that I'd rather they write no business than write unprofitable business. This isn't just a slogan; it's how we actually operate.\n\nThe aggregation of exposures point is equally critical. You can write what looks like profitable business on individual policies, but if you're not careful about how those exposures aggregate, a single catastrophic event can wipe you out. This is why we're so careful about understanding our worst-case scenarios. We never want to be in a position where one event, no matter how unlikely it seems, could threaten our solvency.\n\nThe beautiful thing about our structure is that we don't have to grow. We're not trying to meet quarterly earnings targets or maintain market share for its own sake. If the market is offering us opportunities to write good business at good prices, we'll write billions. If it's not, we'll happily sit on our hands and wait. Our float from existing business isn't going anywhere—we'll still have those funds to invest.\n\nThis patience and selectivity is what's allowed us to generate float at such low cost over time. Yes, we had that terrible year in 2001, and we've had other bad years. But over the long term, our disciplined approach has given us a massive competitive advantage: we have over $41 billion of other people's money to invest, and we've paid very little for the privilege of holding it."

This wasn't some company I looked at for a few months before making an acquisition. I knew the people, I understood the business model, and I had watched them operate with discipline year after year. When we agreed to merge in 1998, I genuinely believed Gen Re was adhering to the three cardinal rules of insurance: disciplined underwriting, conservative reserving, and avoiding dangerous aggregations of risk. But the culture had changed, and I didn't see it. That's on me.\n\nHere's what makes this particularly instructive: culture can deteriorate gradually, and the people inside the organization may not even realize it's happening. Management didn't know they were grossly mispricing business. It wasn't that they were trying to fool anyone – they had lost their moorings without recognizing it. The standards had slipped incrementally, probably through small compromises that seemed reasonable at the time. Maybe they wanted to maintain market share, or maybe competitive pressures led them to shade their pricing just a bit. But those small steps accumulate, and before you know it, you're in a completely different place than where you started.\n\nThe aggregation of risks issue is even more sobering. Gen Re had accumulated exposures to nuclear, chemical, and biological risks that could have bankrupted the company if multiple catastrophic events occurred. These were supposedly \"impossible\" scenarios, but insurers must remain solvent even if the impossible happens. The World Trade Center attack alone would have threatened Gen Re's existence had it remained independent. Think about that – a company with a sterling reputation, built over generations, could have been destroyed by a single event because risk controls had quietly eroded.\n\nWhat's the lesson for due diligence? First, past performance and reputation, while important, aren't sufficient. You need to dig into current practices with fresh eyes. Second, in businesses where risks compound or accumulate – and insurance is the classic example – you must understand not just the average case but the tail risks. What happens in the worst-case scenario? Third, culture is fragile. A disciplined culture can become undisciplined faster than you might imagine, especially if the wrong incentives creep in.\n\nI was lucky that Joe Brandon and Tad Montross were there and knew exactly what needed fixing. They understood that volume means nothing if you're writing unprofitable business. They changed the entire organization's attitude, making clear that we only wanted properly-priced business, period. It took time – insurance policies run off slowly – but by 2002 we had the NCB risk down to tolerable levels and had fundamentally changed the underwriting culture.\n\nThe country song lyric I quoted – \"I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then\" – captures my feelings perfectly. Ignorance was expensive. We had to add $1.31 billion to reserves in 2002 just to correct prior years' estimation mistakes. But the real cost was the risk we unknowingly carried. We were fortunate that worse didn't happen."

But it's particularly critical in insurance because of how the economics work, and because the temptation to chase volume is so seductive.\n\nLet me explain the economics first. In insurance, you collect premiums today and pay claims later – sometimes many years later. That means you're holding what we call \"float,\" which is money that belongs to others but that you can invest in the meantime. If you underwrite profitably – meaning your premiums exceed your losses and expenses – you're essentially getting paid to hold other people's money. That's a wonderful business. But if you underwrite unprofitably, you're paying for the privilege of holding that money. And if you're paying too much, you'd be better off not writing the business at all.\n\nHere's where the volume trap comes in. Insurance is a business where it's remarkably easy to grow. Want to double your revenue? Just cut your prices by 20% and you'll get all the business you want. Your top line will look fantastic. You'll have impressive market share. But you'll be destroying value with every policy you write. The problem is that the destruction isn't immediately visible because claims come in later. By the time you realize you've mispriced the business, you've already written billions of dollars of unprofitable policies that will bleed red ink for years.\n\nThis is exactly what happened at Gen Re before we fixed it. The company was writing business that wasn't properly priced, and the culture had shifted to one where maintaining volume seemed important. Maybe people's bonuses were tied to premium growth. Maybe they feared losing market position. Maybe they told themselves that this particular piece of business was strategic or that they'd make it up elsewhere. These rationalizations are dangerous because they feel reasonable in the moment.\n\nWhen Joe and Tad took over, they made a critical decision: they would judge themselves solely on underwriting profitability. Not on revenue growth. Not on market share. Not on how many policies they wrote. Only on whether the business was profitable. This clarity of purpose is essential because it eliminates the mental gymnastics that lead to bad decisions. If a piece of business isn't properly priced, you don't write it. Period. It doesn't matter if it's a long-standing client, or if your competitors are writing it, or if walking away means your volume drops by half.\n\nThis principle extends far beyond insurance. In any business, revenue growth that comes at the expense of profitability is usually value-destroying. Yet companies constantly fall into this trap because growth is visible and exciting, while profitability requires discipline and sometimes means saying no to opportunities. Wall Street often rewards growth over profitability, at least in the short term, which creates terrible incentives.\n\nThe key is getting the incentives right internally. If you pay people based on volume, you'll get volume. If you pay them based on underwriting profit, you'll get discipline. Joe and Tad understood this instinctively. They knew that Gen Re's value to Berkshire came from generating low-cost float through disciplined underwriting, not from being the biggest reinsurer in the world.\n\nThere's also the reserving piece, which ties directly into this. If you don't reserve conservatively, you don't know your true costs. And if you don't know your costs, you can't price intelligently. You're flying blind. That's why we had to add that painful $1.31 billion to reserves – we had been fooling ourselves about what our actual costs were.\n\nThe bottom line is simple: in insurance, and really in any business, profitability must trump volume. Size for its own sake is meaningless. What matters is earning an adequate return on capital, and that requires the discipline to walk away from business that doesn't meet your standards, even when walking away is uncomfortable."

The danger comes from several characteristics that combine to create a toxic brew for both individual companies and our entire financial system.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the accounting fiction that derivatives create. These contracts allow counterparties to record massive profits and losses in their current earnings statements before a single penny changes hands. Think about what that means. You can show huge profits today based on contracts that won't settle for ten, fifteen, or even twenty years. At Enron, they were booking profits on newsprint and broadband derivatives due to be settled many years in the future. The temptation to use optimistic assumptions and aggressive valuations is enormous, because the day of reckoning is so far away. It's like allowing someone to declare victory in a game that's only half-played.\n\nSecond, there's the creditworthiness problem. Unless these contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their value depends entirely on whether your counterparty can pay up when the time comes. You might think you've made a brilliant trade, but if the other guy goes bankrupt before settlement, you're left holding an empty bag. This creates a web of interconnected risks throughout the financial system. Company A owes Company B, which owes Company C, which owes Company D. When one domino falls, others follow.\n\nNow, let me explain why I compare this business to Hell. When we bought General Re, it came with General Re Securities, a derivatives operation that Charlie and I recognized as dangerous immediately. We tried to sell it – we failed. So we decided to shut it down. That was years ago, and we're still not out of it. We reduce our exposure daily, but it will be many more years before we're completely free.\n\nHere's why: once you write a derivatives contract, you're stuck with it. If you've promised to make a payment based on some future event – whether it's interest rates in 2025 or the price of oil in 2030 – you can't just walk away. You're on the hook. You can try to find someone to take over your position, but that often means paying a hefty price, especially if market conditions have moved against you. And even if you do transfer the contract, you may still have residual liability if the new counterparty fails.\n\nThe reinsurance business works the same way. You write a policy today, collect a premium, and then you wait. Maybe nothing happens. Maybe twenty years from now, you have to pay out millions. You're married to that contract for decades. The difference is that insurance risks are somewhat more predictable and bounded. Derivatives can be tied to anything – the imagination of man, or madmen, is the only limit. Someone wants to speculate on the number of twins born in Nebraska in 2020? Sure, there's a counterparty willing to take the other side at the right price.\n\nThis combination – accounting that allows premature profit recognition, interconnected counterparty risks, and the near-impossibility of exiting positions – makes derivatives extraordinarily dangerous. They're easy to enter because the apparent profits look attractive and the risks seem distant. But once you're in, you're trapped, sometimes for decades."

        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons investors need to understand: just because accounting is \"standard\" or \"generally accepted\" doesn't mean it reflects economic reality. The fact that General Re Securities lost $173 million pre-tax, partly as a belated acknowledgment of faulty accounting it had used in earlier periods, tells you everything you need to know about the gap between reported earnings and actual results in the derivatives business.\n\nLet me explain what happens with derivatives accounting. The standard practice allows companies to mark their derivatives positions to \"market\" – or more accurately, to model – and recognize gains or losses immediately in their income statements. Sounds reasonable, right? The problem is that many derivatives contracts are so complex, so long-dated, and so illiquid that there is no real market for them. There's no exchange where you can look up the price. Instead, companies use models to estimate what these contracts are worth.\n\nNow, think about the incentives at play. If you're running a derivatives trading operation, your compensation probably depends on the profits you report. You've got a contract that won't settle for fifteen years. You need to estimate its current value using assumptions about future interest rates, volatility, correlations between different variables, and the creditworthiness of your counterparty. Every one of these assumptions involves judgment. If you're optimistic in your assumptions – and who wouldn't be when their bonus depends on it? – you can report higher profits today. The beauty, from the trader's perspective, is that by the time reality proves your assumptions wrong, you're long gone, having collected years of bonuses based on phantom profits.\n\nThis is exactly what we saw at General Re Securities. They had been using standard accounting practices, following the rules that everyone else followed. But those practices allowed them to overstate their profits in earlier years. Eventually, reality caught up, and we had to acknowledge losses of $173 million. But here's the thing: that loss didn't represent just one year's bad performance. It represented the unwinding of optimistic assumptions and aggressive valuations that had been built up over many years.\n\nFor investors, this creates a serious problem. When you look at a company's reported earnings, you want to believe those numbers represent economic reality. But in businesses dealing with derivatives, reported earnings can be largely fictional. A company can show steady profits for years while actually building up enormous risks that will only become apparent much later.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I are so skeptical of businesses we don't understand and accounting that requires complex estimates. We want businesses where the cash register rings, where you can see and touch the products, where revenues and costs are real and verifiable. When a company sells you a piece of furniture or insurance policy, you know what happened. Cash came in, product went out. But with derivatives, you're dealing with estimates piled on top of assumptions, all wrapped up in complexity.\n\nThe broader lesson is this: investors need to be extremely wary of any business where reported earnings depend heavily on estimates about the distant future. This applies not just to derivatives, but to any business with long-tailed liabilities or assets that are difficult to value. Don't be reassured just because the accounting is \"standard\" or blessed by auditors. Standard accounting often lags behind financial innovation, and by the time the rules catch up, a lot of damage has been done.\n\nWhen you see a company reporting consistent profits from derivatives trading or other activities that involve complex, long-dated contracts, ask yourself: are these real profits, or are they just estimates that might evaporate when reality arrives? More often than not, if you can't understand how the money is being made, you should assume the reported profits are suspect. That's not cynicism – it's prudence based on watching this movie play out many times over many decades."

        "value": "The Hell analogy isn't just colorful language – it captures something fundamental about certain business commitments that can haunt a company for decades. When you write a reinsurance contract or a derivatives contract, you're making a promise that might not come due for twenty or thirty years, but you're stuck with it from day one. You can't just change your mind when you realize you've made a bad deal.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When a business enters a normal commercial arrangement – say, buying inventory or signing a lease – there are natural exit points. The inventory gets sold, the lease expires, and you move on. But with derivatives and reinsurance, you've created a liability that sits on your books like a time bomb. You might think you've laid off the risk by finding someone else to take the other side, but you almost always retain some residual liability. If that counterparty goes bankrupt or can't pay, guess who's left holding the bag? You are.\n\nThe real danger comes from the combination of this long-term commitment with the uncertainty of valuation. When General Re Securities was winding down, we had over 14,000 contracts with 672 counterparties worldwide. Think about that. Each one of those contracts represented a promise we'd made, and each one had to be valued based on reference items of varying complexity. Some of these were mind-bogglingly complex. You can't just walk away from 14,000 promises, even when you realize the business was a mistake.\n\nThis creates an insidious problem for management. A CEO might recognize that the derivatives operation is dangerous or unprofitable, but unwinding it takes years and often costs far more than anyone anticipated. During that time, you're exposed to all sorts of risks – counterparty risk, market risk, operational risk. It's like trying to get out of a maze where every turn leads to another corridor. Meanwhile, the people who got you into this mess have often long since collected their bonuses and moved on.\n\nThe situation becomes even more treacherous because these long-dated contracts require constant monitoring and management. You need specialized staff, complex systems, and ongoing relationships with counterparties. You can't just put these contracts in a drawer and forget about them. They require feeding and care, consuming management attention and resources that could be devoted to productive activities.\n\nWhat really troubles me is how this affects capital allocation. When you're stuck with these contracts, you're committing capital – sometimes enormous amounts of capital – to support obligations you can't escape. That capital could have been deployed in businesses we understand, businesses that create real value. Instead, it's tied up supporting positions that, in many cases, never should have been entered in the first place. The opportunity cost is staggering, and it compounds over the many years it takes to exit these positions. This is why I say some businesses are like Hell – the entrance is wide and inviting, but once you're in, the exit is nowhere to be found."

And the incentives pushing people down that slope are enormous, which is what makes this so dangerous.\n\nLet's start with mark-to-market, which sounds objective and clean. If you own a share of Coca-Cola stock, you can look up its price at any moment. That's true mark-to-market. But now consider the twins contract I mentioned – a derivative that pays off based on whether twins are born to specific people at some future date. Where exactly do you find a market price for that? You don't, because there is no market. This is where mark-to-model enters the picture.\n\nMark-to-model means you're using mathematical formulas and assumptions to estimate what your contract is worth. Now, here's where human nature takes over. The models require assumptions about future events – interest rates, volatility, correlations between different variables, and countless other inputs. Each assumption is debatable. Each one involves judgment. And here's the key: the people making these judgments have gigantic financial incentives to be optimistic.\n\nThink about the trader who's sitting there with a complex derivatives position. His bonus – maybe millions of dollars – depends on the \"earnings\" his trading book shows. He's not going to pick the most conservative assumptions. He's going to pick assumptions that are defensible, that some academic paper might support, but that tilt toward showing profits. Is he committing fraud? Not necessarily. He might genuinely believe his assumptions are reasonable. But the incentive structure is pushing him inexorably toward optimism.\n\nThe same dynamic affects CEOs. Stock options and reputation depend on reported earnings. When a significant portion of those earnings comes from derivatives positions valued by models, there's tremendous temptation to embrace favorable assumptions. And remember, in many cases, both counterparties to a derivatives contract can use different models and both show profits for years. How is that possible? Because they're both being optimistic in ways that favor their own positions. It's like two people betting on a coin flip, and both claiming they've already won.\n\nThe auditing process, which should catch these problems, faces enormous challenges. When we had those 14,384 contracts at General Re Securities, each involving one or more reference items of varying complexity, how could even expert auditors definitively say what they were worth? Honest auditors could arrive at widely different valuations. The complexity provides cover for aggressive assumptions.\n\nWe've seen this play out dramatically in the energy and utility sectors. Companies reported spectacular earnings from derivatives and trading activities. Executives collected huge bonuses. Stock prices soared. Then, when these companies actually tried to convert their derivatives receivables into cash, the whole house of cards collapsed. The earnings had been a mirage all along – pure mark-to-myth.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the asymmetry of the errors. I can assure you, marking errors in derivatives almost never go in the conservative direction. They don't favor shareholders or long-term value creation. They favor the trader eyeing his bonus and the CEO watching his stock options. By the time shareholders discover the earnings were a sham, the bonuses have been paid, the options have been exercised, and the people responsible have often moved on. The shareholders are left holding an empty bag, having been deceived by accounting that was technically defensible but fundamentally misleading."

        "value": "The pile-on effect from derivatives is particularly insidious because it transforms a manageable problem into an existential crisis almost instantaneously. Let me explain why this is fundamentally different from traditional financial difficulties.\n\nWhen a company faces normal business adversity—say, losing market share or experiencing a bad quarter—it typically has time to respond. Management can cut costs, sell assets, or negotiate with creditors. The problems unfold gradually, and there's usually a period where you can take corrective action. But derivatives collateral calls work entirely differently, and that's what makes them so dangerous.\n\nHere's the mechanism: Many derivatives contracts contain provisions that automatically trigger when a company's credit rating drops. The moment that downgrade hits, the company must immediately post collateral—often enormous amounts of cash—to its counterparties. There's no negotiation, no grace period, no time to arrange financing. It's instantaneous and mandatory.\n\nNow, think about what this means in practice. A company might get downgraded for reasons that have nothing to do with its actual cash position. Maybe there's general economic adversity in its industry, or concerns about future earnings. The company might still have adequate liquidity to run its operations. But suddenly, because of these derivatives contracts, it faces an unexpected demand for billions in cash collateral. This is cash it needs to hand over right now, not next quarter or next month.\n\nThis is where the spiral begins, and it's truly frightening. The company scrambles to meet these collateral calls. Maybe it has to sell assets quickly at fire-sale prices. Maybe it draws down credit lines it was saving for operations. Maybe it can't meet all the demands. When the market sees this distress, what happens? The rating agencies downgrade the company again. And what does that second downgrade trigger? More collateral calls from other derivatives contracts.\n\nYou can see how this becomes a self-reinforcing death spiral. Each downgrade creates liquidity problems, which lead to more downgrades, which create worse liquidity problems. A company that was fundamentally sound—that had good businesses generating cash flow—can be brought to its knees not by operational failure but by these contractual triggers.\n\nCompare this to traditional debt. If you have a bond coming due, you know about it years in advance. You can plan, refinance, or arrange alternatives. Even if you face covenant violations on a loan, there's typically negotiation involved. Banks don't want you to fail; they want to work things out. But derivatives collateral calls are automatic and unforgiving.\n\nThe real danger is that this mechanism can take a company that's merely troubled and turn it into a company that's insolvent, not because its business failed, but because the financial engineering created a liquidity crisis that became impossible to escape. That's why Charlie and I view this pile-on effect as one of the most dangerous aspects of derivatives—it can transform a stumble into a fatal fall with breathtaking speed."

This is exactly the kind of systemic risk that brought down the banking system before the Federal Reserve was created, and we're recreating it in derivatives without any safety net.\n\nLet me start with why individual participants think they're safe. If you're a derivatives dealer, you look at your book and see that you have receivables from hundreds of different counterparties across various industries and geographies. On paper, this looks beautifully diversified. You think, \"Well, if Company A fails to pay me, I've still got Companies B through Z, and they're all in different businesses, different countries, different situations. I'm protected by diversification.\" This logic sounds prudent, and in normal times, it actually works.\n\nBut here's what this analysis misses: correlation isn't static. In calm times, these various counterparties might indeed be independent. But in a crisis—and this is what history teaches us repeatedly—things that seemed unrelated suddenly become highly correlated. An exogenous event, something coming from outside the system, can cause failures to cascade in ways nobody anticipated.\n\nThink about what we still have at Gen Re Securities: $6.5 billion in receivables, even after being in liquidation mode for nearly a year. That's $6.5 billion we're owed by various counterparties. Now, we might have thought we were diversified across these counterparties, but in a real crisis, the failure of one major derivatives dealer could trigger a chain reaction. When Company A can't pay us, it's probably because of some systemic shock. That same shock is likely affecting Company B's ability to pay, and Company C's, and so on down the line.\n\nThe banking parallel I mentioned is instructive. Before the Fed, we had a system where banks were interconnected through various relationships and obligations. When weak banks failed, they couldn't meet their obligations to other banks. This put sudden, unexpected liquidity demands on previously strong banks. These strong banks, facing demands they hadn't anticipated, would then fail themselves, even though their underlying business was sound. The dominoes would topple, one after another.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created specifically to break this chain. The Fed can step in and provide liquidity to fundamentally sound banks, insulating the strong from the troubles of the weak. It acts as a circuit breaker in the system.\n\nBut look at derivatives today. We have the same interconnected structure, the same daisy-chain of obligations, but no Fed equivalent. Huge receivables build up over time among derivatives dealers who trade extensively with each other. The concentration is actually worse than most people realize—large amounts of credit risk are concentrated in the hands of relatively few dealers.\n\nWhen we conduct our reinsurance business, we specifically minimize these links. We don't want our fate tied to a long chain of other companies. If we're going to take a risk, we want it to be a risk we've analyzed and chosen, not a risk that comes from being the fifth or sixth link in a chain where we're exposed to the judgment and solvency of multiple other parties.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I believe the macro picture is dangerous and getting more so. Yes, derivatives can reduce risk for individual participants in specific transactions. But they're creating systemic risk that's building up in the system. And unlike banking, there's no authority with the power and responsibility to prevent the dominoes from toppling. When the crisis comes—and in complex systems, crises always eventually come—the correlations will emerge, the daisy-chain will activate, and fundamentally solid firms will find themselves in trouble simply because of their links to others in the chain."

And when you can't measure risk, you can't manage it properly.\n\nLet me walk you through why this is so pernicious. When Charlie and I read the footnotes in annual reports of major banks detailing their derivatives activities, we're not being modest when we say we don't understand them. We've spent our entire lives analyzing businesses and financial statements. If we can't figure out the risk profile, how can regulators? How can the boards of directors of these institutions? The honest answer is they can't, and that should terrify anyone who thinks about it carefully.\n\nThe problem starts with the interconnectedness. Traditional financial instruments are relatively straightforward. If a bank makes a loan, you can evaluate that loan's quality, look at the collateral, assess the borrower's creditworthiness. But derivatives create these long chains of obligations where Party A owes Party B, who owes Party C, who owes Party D, and so on. And these same parties are often on both sides of multiple transactions with each other. It's like a giant spider web where pulling on one thread can make the whole structure shake in ways you never anticipated.\n\nWhat makes this especially dangerous is the concentration risk I mentioned. These derivatives aren't spread out among thousands of small players. They're concentrated in the hands of relatively few major dealers who all trade extensively with one another. So you've got this situation where the troubles of one institution can rapidly spread to others. It's not just correlation – it's direct contractual linkage.\n\nThe LTCM example I cited really illustrates this perfectly. Here was a hedge fund that employed just a few hundred people, unknown to the general public, yet its potential failure scared the Federal Reserve so badly they had to orchestrate a rescue. Why? Because LTCM's tentacles reached into so many major financial institutions through derivatives contracts that its collapse could have triggered a cascade of failures. And remember, this was in 1998 when the derivatives market was a fraction of its current size.\n\nThe total-return swaps I mentioned show another dimension of the problem – they make a complete mockery of margin requirements and other regulatory safeguards. These regulations were put in place for good reasons, learned through painful experience in previous financial crises. But derivatives allow institutions to effectively circumvent these protections while maintaining the fiction of compliance.\n\nThe electricity and gas industries learned about derivatives toxicity the hard way, and their use of these instruments dropped dramatically after major blow-ups. But in the broader financial system, derivatives continue to expand unchecked because we haven't had that clarifying disaster yet. The key word there is \"yet.\" Central banks and governments haven't found effective ways to control or even monitor these risks, and until they do – or until we have a crisis that forces change – the genie stays out of the bottle, and the risks keep growing."

This should concern everyone because when the financial system gets into trouble, it's not just the traders and bankers who suffer – it's everyone with a bank account, a pension, a job, or a mortgage.\n\nLet me explain how this linkage works. Imagine you're a derivatives dealer, and you've written contracts with multiple counterparties who all seem to have different risk profiles. One is in telecommunications, another in energy trading, another in real estate, and so on. On the surface, these look like diversified risks. But here's the catch: when a major market event occurs, these supposedly independent risks can all blow up at the same time.\n\nI mentioned the implosion of the telecom industry and the decline in merchant power projects as examples. What happened there? In both cases, you had massive overinvestment based on overly optimistic projections, financed with huge amounts of debt and derivatives. When reality set in, it didn't happen gradually – it happened suddenly. And when it did, all the companies in these sectors faced problems simultaneously. If you're a derivatives dealer who thought you were diversified across multiple telecom companies, you suddenly discovered you just had one big telecom bet, and it all went bad at once.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from traditional credit risk. If a bank makes loans to a hundred different small businesses in different industries, those risks really are largely independent. One restaurant failing doesn't make a hardware store more likely to fail. But in the derivatives world, the contracts themselves create connections that wouldn't otherwise exist. These connections are often invisible until stress hits the system.\n\nNow, here's why this matters to people who think they're not involved. When these linkages surface and major financial institutions start getting into trouble, the damage spreads far beyond the derivatives market. Credit markets freeze up, as they did during the LTCM crisis. When credit markets freeze, businesses can't get the financing they need for normal operations. That means layoffs, canceled expansion plans, and economic contraction.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's intervention in the LTCM situation is really instructive here. The Fed doesn't intervene lightly. They acted because they feared a domino effect – LTCM's failure could have caused losses at major banks and securities firms, which could have caused them to pull back from markets, which could have caused other institutions to fail, and so on. This is what systemic risk means. It's not just about one firm or one market – it's about the whole system seizing up.\n\nAnd remember, LTCM was far from a worst-case scenario, as I noted. It paralyzed parts of the fixed-income market for weeks, but imagine something worse – multiple large institutions in trouble simultaneously, during a period of general market stress, with even more derivatives outstanding than existed in 1998. The potential for a true financial crisis is very real.\n\nThe cruel irony is that derivatives were originally developed to help institutions manage and reduce risk. And for individual contracts, that's sometimes true. But what's rational for each individual participant creates collective danger for the system. Each dealer thinks they're managing their risk carefully, but nobody can see the whole picture. It's a classic case where the whole is more dangerous than the sum of its parts, and the people who will pay the price when things go wrong aren't the ones who created the risks – it's ordinary people whose lives depend on a functioning financial system."

Derivatives are dangerous for several reasons, and the danger compounds because these problems feed on each other in ways that are very hard to predict or control.\n\nLet me start with the basic problem: derivatives create a chain of interconnected obligations that can stretch out for years or even decades. When you and I make a normal business transaction, we exchange something of value and we're done. But with derivatives, particularly long-term ones, you're creating a promise that extends far into the future. Now, that promise is only as good as the counterparty's ability to pay when the time comes. And here's where it gets scary – nobody, and I mean nobody, including central banks and government regulators, has an effective way to monitor the total risk in the system.\n\nThink about what happens in a chain reaction. Company A has derivatives contracts with Company B, which has contracts with Company C, and so on. If one link in that chain fails, the stress immediately transmits to all the other links. It's like a row of dominoes, except these dominoes are major financial institutions, and when they fall, they can take down the real economy with them. We saw exactly this play out years later in 2008, though I'm writing this in 2002.\n\nThe second major problem is the uncollateralized nature of many of these receivables. When we talk about uncollateralized, we mean there's no cash or securities set aside to back up these promises. It's just a naked obligation. Companies are carrying these receivables on their books as assets, but whether they'll actually collect on them is a huge question mark. The amounts involved are staggering – we're talking about trillions of dollars in notional value.\n\nNow, here's what really keeps Charlie and me up at night: these contracts are often extraordinarily complex, and they're marked to market using models, not actual market prices. When there's no real market for these instruments, companies use mathematical models to estimate their value. But models are only as good as their assumptions, and we've seen throughout history that models tend to break down precisely when you need them most – during times of stress.\n\nThe \"latent but potentially lethal\" phrase I used is important. In normal times, everything looks fine. The sun is shining, everyone's making money on paper, and the risks seem theoretical. But when a crisis hits, these instruments can create losses that are multiples of a company's capital. And because everything's so interconnected, the crisis spreads like wildfire.\n\nAt Berkshire, we believe in being a fortress of financial strength. That means we don't want to be dependent on the kindness of strangers or the performance of complex models when things go wrong. We want to know that we can meet our obligations to our owners, creditors, policyholders, and employees no matter what happens in the financial markets. That's why we're so apprehensive about derivatives, even though others in the financial world continue to expand their use unchecked. We'd rather be safe than sorry, even if it makes us look overly cautious."

There's a big difference between a fair price and a bargain price. We're not looking for fair prices. We're looking for stocks that are significantly undervalued – where we can buy a dollar's worth of value for fifty or sixty cents. And we're just not finding that in our major holdings or in the market generally.\n\nThis tells you something important about the nature of bubbles and their aftermath. The hangover, as I put it, may prove proportional to the binge. When you have a speculation of the magnitude we saw in the late 1990s, you can't expect to work it off quickly. It takes time for valuations to return to sensible levels, and sometimes it takes a long time. Investors who got burned often stay away from stocks for years. Companies that raised capital at inflated prices have to grow into those valuations, which can take a decade or more.\n\nCharlie and I aren't congenitally averse to stocks – far from it. We love owning common stocks. It's our favorite thing to do with Berkshire's money. But we only love it when we can buy at attractive prices. The wonderful thing about our business is that we don't have to swing at every pitch. We can wait for the fat pitch, and if it doesn't come for months or years, that's fine. We'll just wait.\n\nThe lesson here is that price matters enormously. It's not enough for a company to be good – you have to buy it at a price that makes sense. And after a major bubble, it can take a very long time before prices make sense again. Patience isn't just a virtue in investing – it's a requirement."

        "value": "The discipline of inactivity is one of the hardest lessons for investors to learn, but it's absolutely essential to long-term success. Charlie and I will not deploy capital just because we have it sitting around earning minimal returns. We need to see a very high probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns, which translates to about 6½-7% after corporate tax, before we'll act. And let me be clear – sitting on cash earning less than 1% after-tax is no fun at all. But the alternative – investing in overpriced securities just to be doing something – is far worse.\n\nHere's the fundamental principle: in investing, you're not graded on activity. Nobody gives you points for swinging at every pitch. In fact, it's quite the opposite. You can watch pitch after pitch go by, waiting for the one in your sweet spot, and there's no penalty whatsoever for patience. This is dramatically different from most businesses, where inactivity can be fatal. If you run a retail store and just sit there doing nothing, you'll go broke. But in investing, doing nothing is often the most intelligent thing you can do.\n\nThe reason this discipline matters so much is that capital preservation is paramount. If you lose money on bad investments made simply because you felt compelled to be active, you've done two terrible things. First, you've suffered a permanent loss of capital. Second, you've eliminated the possibility of deploying that capital when truly attractive opportunities emerge. And believe me, they will emerge. In my 61 years of investing, about 50 years have offered the kind of opportunities where we could purchase common stocks at attractive prices. The other years required patience.\n\nNow, let's address the opportunity cost question directly. Yes, when short-term money is returning less than 1% after-tax, and we're sitting on billions of dollars, the immediate opportunity cost feels significant. We're \"losing\" the spread between what we could earn if attractive investments were available and what we're actually earning in Treasury bills or short-term instruments. That spread might be 6% or more annually, which on large sums adds up quickly.\n\nBut here's what you must understand: the real opportunity cost runs in the other direction. The true cost isn't what you fail to earn on cash during periods of overvaluation. The true cost is what you lose permanently by investing in overpriced securities. If you pay $1 for something worth 60 cents just because you're impatient, you've lost 40 cents permanently. That loss is real and irreversible. The \"loss\" from holding cash is merely an opportunity cost – it's not a permanent impairment of capital.\n\nFurthermore, holding cash during periods of overvaluation positions you to act decisively when prices become attractive. Markets periodically go through periods of fear and distress. When that happens, having capital available is enormously valuable. The investors who felt compelled to stay fully invested during the bubble years found themselves unable to take advantage of opportunities when they finally appeared. We've seen this pattern repeat throughout history, and it will continue to repeat.\n\nSo yes, inactivity can be uncomfortable. It tests your patience and your discipline. But it's a crucial part of successful investing, and we're perfectly willing to endure that discomfort rather than compromise our standards for capital deployment."

These are really two distinct disciplines that happen to share some surface similarities but differ profoundly in their underlying characteristics.\n\nWhen we invest in equities at Berkshire, we're concentrating on conservatively financed businesses with strong competitive strengths, run by able and honest people. If we buy into these companies at sensible prices, losses should be rare. And indeed, they have been rare – during the 38 years we've run the company's affairs, gains from equities have exceeded losses by a ratio of about 100 to one. That's not luck; that's the result of focusing on high-quality businesses with durable competitive advantages.\n\nThink about what we're really buying when we purchase stocks. We're buying pieces of businesses that have economic moats – sustainable competitive advantages that protect them from competition. These might be powerful brands, network effects, cost advantages, or regulatory positions. We're buying businesses that generate high returns on capital without requiring excessive leverage. And critically, we're buying into management teams we trust to allocate capital wisely and treat shareholders fairly. When you combine these factors and purchase at reasonable prices, the probability of permanent capital loss becomes very small.\n\nNow contrast that with junk bonds. When we purchase junk bonds, we're dealing with enterprises that are far more marginal. These businesses are usually overloaded with debt – that's often why their bonds are rated as junk in the first place. They frequently operate in industries characterized by low returns on capital, which means they lack the economic moats that protect our equity investments. Additionally, the quality of management is sometimes questionable, and management may even have interests that are directly counter to those of debtholders. Management works for the equity holders, and in a highly leveraged company, management might take risks that benefit equity at the expense of debt holders.\n\nSo why do we invest in junk bonds at all? Because both activities require us to make a price-value calculation, and occasionally we find junk bonds where the reward-risk ratio is attractive. We scan hundreds of securities to find the very few that offer compelling value. The key difference is in our expectations. With equities in wonderful businesses, we expect consistent success. With junk bonds, we expect occasional large losses, but we structure our portfolio so that our winners more than compensate for our losers.\n\nThis gets to a crucial point about risk and return. Risk isn't eliminated by diversification alone or by avoiding certain categories of investments. Risk is a function of price relative to value. A high-quality business purchased at an excessive price is risky. A marginal business purchased at a sufficiently cheap price might offer an attractive risk-reward proposition. The key is understanding what you own, being honest about its limitations, and ensuring you're being adequately compensated for the risks you're taking.\n\nIn junk bonds, we know we're dealing with fragile enterprises. We price that fragility into our calculations. We expect some to fail. But if we're careful in our analysis and disciplined in our pricing, we can earn acceptable returns despite those failures. It's a different game than equity investing in wonderful businesses, and we treat it as such. We don't confuse the two approaches, and we don't apply equity-like expectations to junk bond portfolios. Understanding these distinctions – really understanding them at a deep level – is essential to avoiding costly mistakes in investing."

        "from": "gpt",

The problem is that boardrooms operate under social conventions that make it extraordinarily difficult for even well-intentioned directors to fulfill their duties. It's a triumph of manners over responsibility.\n\nLet me walk you through how this actually works. Imagine you're sitting in a boardroom with ten other directors, all successful, well-mannered people. The CEO, who selected most of you for the board, is presenting his latest acquisition idea. He's brought in his management team and expensive outside advisors – investment bankers, lawyers, consultants – all of whom are nodding along enthusiastically. Of course they're enthusiastic; they wouldn't be in that room if they had reservations. Now, in that moment, you have doubts about whether this acquisition makes sense. What happens when you speak up? You're not just questioning a business decision; you're implicitly suggesting that the CEO and all these experts might be wrong. You're violating the social compact of the boardroom. It's like belching at the dinner table, as I said about questioning excessive CEO compensation.\n\nThe same dynamic applies even more forcefully when it comes to replacing a mediocre CEO. This is someone you've worked with for years, who's probably a likable person, who invited you to join the board, who you see socially. Raising the question of whether he should be fired feels like a personal betrayal, even though it's precisely what your fiduciary duty requires. The boardroom atmosphere makes it almost impossible to separate the business judgment from the personal relationship.\n\nHere's what makes this so insidious: these aren't bad people. They're intelligent, successful, and they genuinely believe they're doing the right thing. But they've drifted, to use Mae West's phrase. They started out knowing their responsibility was to the shareholders, but gradually the social dynamics of the boardroom took over. They became more concerned with collegiality than with performance, more worried about awkwardness than about their fiduciary duty.\n\nThis is why I'm enthusiastic about having outside directors meet regularly without the CEO present. It changes the atmosphere. When the CEO isn't in the room, directors can speak more freely about whether he's doing a good job. They can question his proposals without the social awkwardness of doing it to his face in front of his team. It's not that directors are cowards – it's that they're human beings operating in a social environment that's been structured, often unconsciously, to discourage the very independence and critical thinking that shareholders need.\n\nThe broader lesson here is that structure matters enormously. You can have the right laws, the right people, and the right intentions, but if you have the wrong structure – if the social dynamics work against good decision-making – you'll get bad results. That's why governance reforms need to focus on changing the actual dynamics of how boards operate, not just adding more rules about independence or qualifications."

I've seen plenty of independent directors over my forty years on nineteen different boards who were utterly useless to shareholders. They met every technical definition of independence, but they lacked the qualities that actually matter for protecting shareholder interests.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by the three essential qualities. First, business-savvy. A director needs to understand how businesses actually work – how they make money, how they lose money, what creates durable competitive advantages, what destroys value. This isn't something you can learn from a governance manual. I've sat with directors who were independent by any measure but who couldn't tell the difference between a good business and a bad one, who couldn't evaluate whether management's capital allocation decisions made sense, who couldn't assess whether an acquisition was strategic brilliance or CEO empire-building. What good is their independence if they can't make sound business judgments?\n\nSecond, interested. This might sound obvious, but many directors simply aren't engaged. They show up to meetings, they collect their fees, but they haven't really studied the business. They haven't read the competitors' annual reports. They don't understand the industry dynamics. They're going through the motions. You can be completely independent and still be asleep at the switch. An interested director is someone who genuinely cares about the company's performance, who does the homework, who thinks about the business between meetings. This quality can't be mandated by regulation.\n\nThird, shareholder-oriented. This is crucial. A director must think like the owner of a business, not like a member of a club. They need to behave as if there's a single absentee owner whose long-term interests they're protecting. That means being willing to make the hard decisions – firing a likable but mediocre CEO, opposing an acquisition that would be exciting for management but bad for shareholders, pushing back on excessive compensation even when it creates awkwardness.\n\nNow, here's why the current focus on independence misses the mark. The governance reformers have created all these rules and tests for independence – you can't have worked for the company, you can't have business relationships with the company, you can't be related to management, and so on. These rules might screen out some conflicts of interest, but they do nothing to ensure that directors are business-savvy, interested, or shareholder-oriented. You can satisfy every independence test and still be ignorant about business, lazy about preparation, and more concerned with collegiality than with protecting shareholders.\n\nWhat's worse, the focus on independence can actually backfire. Sometimes the most valuable director is someone who has deep knowledge of the industry or the company, but who might not meet some technical independence test. I'd rather have a director who truly understands the business and thinks like an owner, even if he has some tangential relationship with the company, than someone who's perfectly independent but brings nothing to the table.\n\nThe real problem, as I discussed earlier, isn't independence – it's boardroom atmosphere and the social dynamics that prevent even independent directors from doing their jobs. Adding more independence requirements doesn't fix that. What fixes it is having directors with the business judgment, the engagement, and the shareholder orientation to overcome those social pressures and do what's right for the owners of the business."

You can have someone who's perfectly independent by every legal definition, who has no business ties to the company, no family connections, nothing that creates a technical conflict – and yet that person can be completely useless to shareholders, or worse, actively harmful.\n\nLet me explain what I mean. In my 1993 commentary, I laid out three essential qualities for directors: business savvy, shareholder orientation, and genuine independence of thought. Now, that third one sounds like what the regulations are trying to capture, but it's really quite different. The regulations define independence by what you aren't – you aren't employed by the company, you aren't a consultant, you aren't related to management. But true independence is about what you are – it's about having the backbone to speak up when management proposes something foolish, even when everyone else in that boardroom is nodding along.\n\nHere's the real issue: you can meet every technical requirement for independence and still lack the other two critical qualities. If you don't understand business deeply – if you can't look at an acquisition proposal and recognize that management is paying twice what something is worth, or if you can't see that a compensation package is designed to enrich executives rather than align their interests with shareholders – then your independence is worthless. You're like a watchdog that doesn't know what to bark at.\n\nAnd the shareholder orientation piece is equally crucial. I've sat in boardrooms with plenty of independent directors who were decent, intelligent people, but they simply didn't care enough about the shareholders to make waves. They enjoyed the prestige of being on the board, they liked the fees, they valued the relationships with other directors and management. When push came to shove, they weren't willing to be the skunk at the garden party.\n\nI have to confess my own failings here. There were times when I was silent when I should have spoken up. I saw management making proposals that I knew were counter to shareholder interests, but I didn't want to create conflict. That's what I mean by collegiality trumping independence – the social dynamics of the boardroom, the desire to be agreeable, the discomfort of being the one dissenting voice, all of that overwhelms whatever technical independence you might have.\n\nThe current system creates a false sense of security. Companies and regulators check the boxes – yes, we have independent directors, we meet the requirements – but they're not asking whether those directors actually have the knowledge to evaluate management's proposals or the courage to say no when necessary. It's like having a board of art critics who've never studied art and are too polite to say when a painting is terrible. The independence is real in a technical sense, but it's completely ineffective in practice, and shareholders are the ones who pay the price for this charade."

And the answer is: they do essentially nothing.\n\nThink about what these directors are supposed to be doing. They represent millions of investors who've entrusted their savings to these funds. Those investors are counting on the directors to act exactly as they would act themselves – to find the best possible investment manager and to negotiate hard on fees, because over time, those fees compound and can destroy a huge portion of returns. These aren't complicated duties. If you were investing your own money, you'd absolutely look around at different managers, you'd compare performance, and you'd try to get the best deal you could on fees.\n\nBut that's not what happens. Year after year, the directors of Fund A rubber-stamp Manager A, the directors of Fund B rubber-stamp Manager B, and on and on in this zombie-like process. I use that word deliberately – zombies, because there's no independent thought happening. The managers could deliver substandard performance year after year, and it never enters these directors' minds to suggest looking at alternatives. A monkey typing randomly would produce a Shakespeare play before these independent directors would actually exercise independent judgment about changing managers.\n\nNow here's where the hypocrisy becomes absolutely vivid and undeniable. When Manager A gets sold to Manager B for some huge sum – we're talking hundreds of millions or billions of dollars changing hands – suddenly these same independent directors have a revelation. They decide that Manager B is now the best available option, even though Manager B was available all along and they never considered it before. This is logically absurd. If Manager B is the best choice now, it was the best choice last year too, and probably could have been hired at a much lower rate before it paid a fortune to acquire Manager A.\n\nWhat this reveals is that these directors aren't actually making independent judgments at all. They're going along with whatever management wants, whatever maintains the status quo, whatever keeps everyone comfortable. The social and business relationships, the desire not to rock the boat, the path of least resistance – all of that overwhelms any sense of fiduciary duty.\n\nAnd here's the kicker that really exposes the whole charade: when these same directors are handling their own money, they behave completely differently. They'll shop around for advisors, they'll move their money if they're not getting good performance, they'll negotiate on fees. They know how to act in their own self-interest. But when they're acting as fiduciaries for others, when they're supposed to bring that same diligence and care to other people's money, they simply don't do it.\n\nThis tells you something profound about human nature and about how our current governance system fails. Legal independence doesn't create real independence of thought or action. It doesn't make people care about shareholders the way they care about themselves. The mutual fund industry has operated under federal requirements for independent directors since 1940, and the result has been an absolute failure of stewardship. Investors have paid billions in excessive fees to underperforming managers, all overseen by independent directors who were independent in name only. That's the reality of how independence works in practice, and it's a reality that shareholders need to understand."

But when independence is just a legal checkbox rather than a state of mind, shareholders get no protection at all.\n\nLet me walk you through why real independence is so rare. Think about how these director positions work in practice. My daughter was offered a directorship that would have increased her income by fifty percent. Now, legally, she would have been \"independent\" - she had no business ties to the fund manager, she wasn't an employee, all the legal boxes were checked. But ask yourself: did the manager who approached her think there was any chance she'd vote to fire them and hire a different advisor? Of course not. They were buying loyalty with those generous fees, and they knew exactly what they were buying.\n\nThe incentive structure is completely backwards. When a director is asked to negotiate lower management fees, what happens? If they succeed in cutting fees from, say, one percent to seventy-five basis points, the manager loses millions of dollars while the director gains absolutely nothing. In fact, the director might lose something - the manager's goodwill, future board seats, the comfortable relationship. But if the director does nothing, keeps fees high, and keeps the manager happy, they keep collecting those six-figure fees from serving on multiple boards in the fund family. When one party cares deeply about the outcome and the other party is indifferent or actually benefits from inaction, you don't need to be a genius to predict who wins.\n\nThis is why I was so proud when my daughter turned down that offer. She showed real independence - the kind that actually costs you something. But here's the depressing part: the fund had no trouble filling that slot with someone else, and surprise, surprise, the fund never changed managers. There's always someone willing to be \"independent\" in name only.\n\nThe broader problem is that we've created a system where the people who are supposed to be watchdogs have been turned into lapdogs. Tens of thousands of these \"independent\" directors, over more than six decades, have failed at their basic responsibilities. They haven't protected shareholders on management fees, they haven't fired mediocre managers, and they haven't stood up to overreaching by the able ones. Meanwhile, compensation committees - which are also staffed by \"independent\" directors - have presided over an explosion in CEO pay that has no relationship to performance.\n\nWhat's missing is a countervailing force. Directors won't provide it because their incentives are wrong. What we need is action by big owners - institutional investors who actually care about the outcomes and have enough clout to make a difference. Twenty of the largest institutions, acting together, could reform governance at any company simply by withholding votes from directors who tolerate bad behavior. The logistics are easy; what's missing is the will."

Manager A runs a fund for years. Then Manager B comes along and pays a huge premium to acquire Manager A's management company - not the fund itself, mind you, but the company that manages the fund. Manager B has now laid out a fortune for this acquisition. But here's the key question: who's going to pay for B's acquisition cost? The answer is the fund's shareholders, the very people who had no say in this transaction and derive no benefit from it.\n\nYou see, Manager B must now recoup that acquisition cost through the fees paid by the shareholders who were \"delivered\" as part of the deal. So fees that might have been negotiated downward are instead maintained at high levels or even increased. The shareholders who were with Manager A are now stuck paying inflated fees to Manager B, not because they're getting better management - Manager B was available and ignored in previous years - but because B needs to recover what it paid to acquire A.\n\nNow, here's where the \"independent\" directors come in, and this is rich. These same directors who previously decided Manager A was just fine suddenly experience what I call a \"counter-revelation.\" They now decide that Manager B is the best that can be found, even though B could have been hired years earlier at a much lower rate. What changed? Nothing about B's capabilities - B is the same manager it always was. What changed is that B now owns A, and the directors are going along with a transaction that benefits the managers while harming shareholders.\n\nWhy don't directors stop this? Because stopping it would require them to think and act independently, and as I've explained, real independence is rare. The directors know which side their bread is buttered on. They're collecting substantial fees - often well into six figures when you add up multiple boards within a fund family. The manager cares deeply about maintaining those fee streams and recovering acquisition costs. The directors? They're indifferent to the shareholders' interests because protecting shareholders costs the directors something - the manager's goodwill, their comfortable positions, their generous fees.\n\nThis is why I recommended John Bogle's book on mutual funds. John understood that the mutual fund industry had evolved into something that primarily served the managers rather than the investors. The structure practically guarantees it. When you have captive shareholders who can't easily fire their manager, directors who won't fire their manager, and managers who can use shareholder money to fund their own empire-building through acquisitions, you've created a system ripe for abuse.\n\nThe practical lesson for investors is clear: pay attention to costs, because in many cases you're not just paying for management, you're paying for the manager's acquisition strategy. And understand that those \"independent\" directors aren't going to protect you. If I or Charlie were empowered to negotiate fees at most mutual funds, we could easily get materially lower rates. And if directors were promised a portion of the savings they achieved, the skies would be filled with falling fees. But under the current system, fee reductions mean nothing to directors while meaning everything to managers, so guess who wins? It's not the shareholders, I can tell you that."

And frankly, many of them are CEOs themselves at other companies, so they're not exactly eager to set precedents that might affect their own pay.\n\nWhat really galls me is what happened in the 1990s and beyond. CEOs adopted Samuel Gompers' old labor union battle cry of \"More!\"—and boy, did they get it. We saw CEO pay packages that bore no relationship to performance. Shareholders would lose money, stock prices would stagnate or fall, and yet CEOs would walk away with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. It's not capitalism when you get rich while your owners get poor—it's piracy.\n\nThe SEC requires compensation committees to explain their reasoning in the proxy statement, but have you read these things? They're boilerplate nonsense, usually written by lawyers or human resources departments. Nobody actually explains how they think about pay or how they measure performance in any meaningful way.\n\nHere's what needs to happen: Directors on compensation committees should behave as if they're spending their own money, because in a sense, they are—or they should be if they own significant stock. There's nothing wrong with paying well for truly exceptional performance. If a CEO creates enormous value for shareholders, by all means, reward them handsomely. But for anything short of that, it's time to shout \"Less!\" The bloated pay of recent years cannot become the baseline going forward. That would be a travesty that perpetuates the problem for another generation."

You can check all the boxes—a director might not be a former employee, might not have business relationships with the company, might not be a family member of management—and still not truly represent shareholders. Real independence comes from having your own money on the line in a meaningful way.\n\nLet me explain why ownership changes everything. When directors own stock they've purchased with their own money—not stock they've been given, not options they've received as compensation, but shares they've actually bought—their interests align with shareholders in a way that no amount of formal independence requirements can replicate. They feel losses in their gut. They celebrate gains with genuine enthusiasm. They think like owners because they are owners.\n\nCompare this to the typical director who receives, say, $200,000 in annual fees and maybe some restricted stock grants. Sure, that's nice money, but is it enough to make them willing to create an uncomfortable confrontation with a CEO they probably like personally? Is it enough to make them risk not being renominated to the board, losing that prestige and those fees? Usually not. The board fees and the social aspects of being a director—the prestige, the connections, the pleasant meetings—these things can actually work against shareholder interests because directors don't want to rock the boat.\n\nNow think about a director who has $50 million or $100 million of their own wealth invested in the company. When management proposes something foolish, that director isn't thinking about preserving a comfortable board seat. They're thinking about their own fortune. When the compensation committee discusses CEO pay, they're acutely aware that every excess dollar going to management is coming out of their pocket and the pockets of their fellow shareholders. That's the kind of motivation that matters.\n\nThis is why I mentioned that some major investing institutions have \"glass house\" problems. They push for governance reforms at other companies, but they'd shudder at the thought of their own performance and fees being scrutinized closely. They don't want the same standards applied to them that they demand of others. That's not leadership—that's hypocrisy.\n\nThe good news is that real reform is possible. I mentioned Jack Bogle, Chris Davis, and Bill Miller as examples of people providing genuine leadership. These are folks who understand that institutional investors, particularly pension funds and other fiduciaries, have both the power and the responsibility to demand better governance. Twenty or fewer of the largest institutions, acting together, could reform corporate governance at any given company simply by withholding votes for directors who tolerate bad behavior. The logistics aren't tough—ownership is concentrated enough that this is entirely feasible.\n\nAt Berkshire, we're going to comply with the new independence requirements, but we're adding our own test that we think matters far more. We want directors whose actions will be influenced by their ownership interests to a degree that dwarfs other considerations. When someone has huge amounts of their own money invested, they'll ask the tough questions. They'll challenge management when necessary. They'll think long-term because they're in it for the long-term.\n\nThe bottom line is this: formal independence is fine as far as it goes, but true ownership creates a level of engagement and alignment that no regulatory requirement can mandate. Show me a director with serious skin in the game, and I'll show you someone who's truly independent in the way that matters most to shareholders."

The regulators focus on formal relationships – does a director do business with the company, do they have family connections, things like that. But they're missing the forest for the trees. Real independence comes from having your financial interests so aligned with shareholders that nothing else matters much to you. That's why we look for directors with huge ownership stakes that they've purchased themselves.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. If you're a director making $50,000 a year from board fees, and that represents 20% or more of your income, you've got a serious conflict of interest. You're going to think twice, three times, maybe a dozen times before you challenge the CEO or rock the boat in any way. Why? Because your livelihood depends on staying in good graces with management and fellow directors who control your reputation in corporate circles. You want to get invited to other boards to earn more fees. That's just human nature, and we shouldn't pretend otherwise.\n\nNow contrast that with someone like Ron Olson, who's on our board. The regulators might question his independence because Berkshire pays legal fees to his firm. But here's the thing – those fees represent a tiny fraction of his substantial income. They're essentially meaningless to him financially. Yet under the formal rules, he might be considered less independent than someone whose entire financial security depends on pleasing management to keep collecting board fees. That's absurd.\n\nAt Berkshire, we pay our directors a pittance precisely because we want the fees to be meaningless. We want their decisions driven entirely by what happens to their family's net worth as Berkshire shareholders, not by their compensation as directors. When you own millions of dollars of stock that you purchased with your own money, you think like an owner. You ask tough questions. You push back when something doesn't make sense. You don't worry about being invited to the next board because you're already wealthy and your focus is on protecting and growing your investment.\n\nThis gets to a fundamental principle that applies far beyond board composition. Incentives matter enormously in human behavior, and the best incentive is having your own money on the line in a big way. Charlie and I manage Berkshire with the overwhelming majority of our net worth in the company. We eat our own cooking. That's the equation that works for us as managers, and it's the right equation for directors too.\n\nThe other piece of this puzzle is that we don't provide directors' and officers' liability insurance. This isn't just about saving money, though we've saved millions over the years. It's about making sure our directors can't be insulated from disaster. If something goes terribly wrong at Berkshire, our directors' personal wealth is on the line, just like any other shareholder. That concentrates the mind wonderfully and ensures they're thinking about risk the right way."

That's why having Buffett family members on the board after I'm gone isn't about nepotism or control – it's about having guardians who understand in their bones what makes Berkshire special and who have every incentive to protect it.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by Berkshire's culture. We operate with a level of trust and decentralization that's almost unheard of in a company our size. We have dozens of operating managers running their businesses with virtually no interference from headquarters. We don't have a general counsel's office breathing down their necks, we don't have layers of corporate bureaucracy, and we don't have the usual corporate politics. Our managers know they're trusted completely as long as they protect Berkshire's reputation and communicate bad news early. This culture has allowed us to attract and retain exceptional business operators who value their autonomy.\n\nNow here's the problem: cultures can change almost imperceptibly at first, then all at once. A new CEO might think, \"Well, we should probably have a few more controls here.\" Then someone suggests we need a corporate strategic planning department. Before you know it, you've got consultants running around, managers spending half their time in meetings at headquarters, and the whole thing that made Berkshire special has evaporated. It happens at companies all the time.\n\nFamily members on the board serve as cultural antibodies. They're not there to manage the business – we'll have professional managers for that, and they'll be fully empowered to run the company. But family members will be there in board meetings when someone proposes something that sounds reasonable on the surface but would actually undermine what makes Berkshire work. They can say, \"Wait a minute, that's not how we do things here, and here's why.\" They have the institutional memory and the standing to push back without any career concerns or worries about being invited to other boards.\n\nThe family members will have enormous amounts of their own wealth in Berkshire stock, so they're completely aligned with shareholders. They're not receiving compensation, so there's no conflict of interest. And critically, they understand that their role is stewardship, not control. They're there to ensure that future CEOs understand and maintain the principles that have made Berkshire successful: extreme decentralization, trust in our managers, capital allocation discipline, and a long-term orientation that doesn't worry about quarterly earnings or what Wall Street thinks.\n\nThis matters tremendously for both shareholders and managers. Shareholders need to know that the company won't drift toward becoming a typical conglomerate with all the bureaucracy and value destruction that entails. And our operating managers need to know that the deal they signed up for – autonomy in exchange for performance and integrity – will remain in place. Many of our managers are independently wealthy and could retire tomorrow. They work because they love running their businesses and they trust Berkshire's structure. Preserving that trust is essential.\n\nThe composition of our board won't change how Charlie and I run things today, but it will help ensure that Berkshire remains Berkshire long after we're gone. That's worth far more than any conventional approach to board governance."

Now, this didn't happen because auditors are bad people. It happened because of basic human nature and the way incentives work in the real world.\n\nLet me walk you through the psychology here. If you're an auditor, who do you see every day? Management. Who calls you with questions? The CFO. Who decides whether to renew your contract next year? The CEO. Who determines whether you get that lucrative consulting work on the side? Management again. So even though the textbooks and the legal documents say you work for the shareholders, your day-to-day reality tells you something completely different. You're having lunch with the CFO, not with shareholders scattered across the country. This is just human nature at work.\n\nNow, here's where it gets really problematic. In recent years, we've seen far too many managers fudge their numbers. Sometimes they use accounting tricks that are technically legal but deeply misleading. Other times they use operational techniques, like stuffing the distribution channel at quarter-end, that make results look better than they really are. And here's the kicker: the auditors often knew about these deceptions. They understood what was happening. But they stayed silent because they didn't want to offend the people who, in practical terms, were paying their bills.\n\nThe recent reforms people have put in place don't really address this fundamental problem. You can write all the rules you want about audit committee structure and charters, but if you don't change the basic incentives and relationships, you won't change the behavior. It's like rearranging the deck chairs when what you really need is to change the ship's course.\n\nWhat will actually work is making auditors genuinely afraid of misleading the audit committee. They need to worry more about the consequences of staying silent than about making management uncomfortable. That's why I've proposed that audit committees ask specific, pointed questions and record the answers for shareholders to see.\n\nTake my first question: if the auditor were solely responsible for the financial statements, would they have prepared them differently? This question cuts right to the heart of the matter. It forces the auditor to go on record. If there's any difference between what management did and what the auditor would have done, both sides have to explain their reasoning, and the audit committee evaluates who's right.\n\nThis approach works because it changes the liability equation. When auditors know their answers will be recorded and reported to shareholders, and when they understand they'll face major monetary penalties for not being forthright, suddenly their incentives shift. Now they're worried about the audit committee and the shareholders, not about pleasing management. That's the way it should have been all along, but we need to create the structure that makes it happen in practice, not just in theory."

        "value": "The principle here is really about respecting everyone's time and focusing on what actually matters. Charlie and I have always believed that corporate governance should be about making good decisions and protecting shareholders, not about creating the appearance of good governance. Unfortunately, most companies have it backwards.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by substance over form. Substance is the board actually thinking hard about who should succeed the CEO and whether the company's capital allocation makes sense. Form is having elaborate PowerPoint presentations at every board meeting and checking boxes on governance checklists. Substance is directors who understand the business deeply and ask tough questions. Form is having the right committee structure on paper and following Roberts Rules of Order religiously.\n\nNow, why do so many companies emphasize form over substance? Part of it is legal defensiveness. Lawyers tell companies that if they follow certain procedures and document everything properly, they'll be protected if something goes wrong. There's some truth to that, but it misses the bigger point. The best protection against things going wrong is having smart, engaged directors who actually prevent problems rather than just documenting that they held meetings about problems.\n\nAnother reason is that form is easier than substance. Anyone can create a presentation. Anyone can schedule quarterly meetings and take minutes. But actually thinking deeply about whether a company's strategy makes sense or whether management is being honest about the challenges they face requires real work and real courage. It's much easier to go through the motions than to ask the CEO uncomfortable questions about why the company's competitive position is eroding.\n\nThere's also a cultural element. Many boards have become social institutions where everyone's polite and nobody rocks the boat. Directors don't want to seem difficult or unsupportive. They want to be team players. So meetings become these scripted affairs where management presents, directors ask a few gentle questions, and everyone congratulates each other. That's form without substance.\n\nAt Berkshire, we take a different approach. Our board meetings are short because we don't waste time on presentations that could have been sent in advance. We focus on the decisions that actually matter, particularly succession planning. That's the most important job our board has, and it's something they think about seriously, not just when it becomes urgent.\n\nThe economic principles I mention on pages sixty-eight through seventy-four are another example of emphasizing substance. These principles describe how we actually run the business and make decisions. They're not platitudes or aspirational statements. They're the real rules we follow. When we add new directors, we want people who genuinely believe in those principles, not people who'll just nod along.\n\nHere's the practical implication for investors: when you're evaluating a company, look at what the board actually does, not what the governance documents say. Does the board have directors who own significant stock and think like owners? Do they ask management tough questions? Or do they just show up four times a year for elaborate presentations? The companies with the best governance often have the simplest structures, because they're focused on substance. The companies with the most elaborate governance procedures are often compensating for weak directors or problematic management. Form becomes a substitute for substance, and shareholders suffer as a result."

You can have the most impressive collection of independent directors sitting on that committee, but if they're not asking the tough questions, you've accomplished nothing. It's like having a watchdog that never barks – the breed doesn't matter much if it just sleeps all day.\n\nThe real issue is that auditors have been allowed to hide behind passive acquiescence rather than active endorsement. There's a world of difference between those two positions. When an auditor merely acquiesces, they're essentially saying, \"Well, I suppose you could interpret the rules that way.\" When they actively endorse something, they're putting their professional reputation on the line and saying, \"Yes, this is right.\" That difference is everything.\n\nLet me walk you through why these four questions change the game. The first question – asking if the auditor would have done anything differently and requiring disclosure of both sides – eliminates the private negotiations where auditors cave to management pressure. Right now, these discussions happen behind closed doors, and by the time the audit committee sees anything, it's a done deal. Management and the auditors have already worked out their compromises, and the committee just rubber-stamps it. By forcing both arguments into the open, you create accountability.\n\nThe second question gets at something fundamental: plain English communication. If the auditor wouldn't understand the financials as an investor, how can actual investors be expected to understand them? This cuts through all the technical jargon and complexity that companies use to obscure reality. It's a simple test, but it's powerful.\n\nThe third question is one I particularly like because it forces auditors to think about whether they'd accept the same procedures if they were running the company. If the answer is no, that tells you something important. The auditor might be tolerating sloppiness or aggressive accounting that they'd never accept in their own house.\n\nThe fourth question about moving revenues and expenses between periods gets directly at the games companies play. This is where a lot of mischief happens, and auditors often know about it but don't speak up unless specifically asked.\n\nHere's the key insight: when you tell auditors in advance that they'll need to affirmatively endorse management's decisions to the audit committee, their behavior changes from day one. They can't just go along to get along anymore. They'll push back early in the process, before questionable accounting gets baked into the numbers. The fear of plaintiff lawyers – and believe me, that fear is real – will ensure they take their duty seriously.\n\nThe timing requirement of asking these questions a week before earnings release is equally important. When the committee waits until the last minute, everyone feels pressure to just approve whatever's in front of them. The earnings release is scheduled, analysts are waiting, and nobody wants to be the one who causes a delay. That pressure leads to bad decisions. Give it a week, and you create space for honest discussion and resolution of differences.\n\nThis approach works because it's prophylactic rather than reactive. We're preventing problems rather than trying to fix them after they've already contaminated the financial statements."

A few decades ago, Andersen's audit opinion was the gold standard – it meant something. They had this Professional Standards Group that insisted on honest reporting regardless of client pressure. That's exactly what you want from auditors. But then something changed, and that change tells you everything you need to know about what went wrong in corporate America.\n\nThe stock options issue crystallizes the problem beautifully. In 1992, Andersen's PSG took the correct position that stock options are an expense and should be recorded as such. This isn't complicated – if you're giving someone something of value as compensation, it's an expense. If I pay my employees in cash, that's an expense. If I pay them in stock options, that's also an expense. The accounting should reflect economic reality.\n\nBut the rainmaking partners – the ones bringing in client fees – reversed that position. Why? Because they knew what their clients wanted. CEOs were handing themselves obscene option grants, and they didn't want the true cost showing up on the income statement. If those costs had to be recorded, boards and shareholders would have seen just how much was being given away, and the megagrants would have been cut back dramatically.\n\nThink about the incentives at work here. The rainmaking partners at Andersen were paid based on the revenue they generated from clients. Their personal wealth depended on keeping those clients happy. The PSG members, on the other hand, were trying to maintain professional standards. When those two groups came into conflict, money won. It's that simple and that depressing.\n\nThis same dynamic played out at the FASB level. The independent accounting board voted 7-0 to require expensing of options. Seven to zero! This wasn't a close call among accounting experts. But then corporate America, led by CEOs who wanted to keep their option gravy train running, lobbied furiously against it. And they won. The accounting rules were kept deliberately misleading to serve the interests of executives rather than investors.\n\nHere's why this matters so much: accounting is supposed to be the language of business. When that language is corrupted – when it's designed to obscure rather than illuminate – investors can't make informed decisions. They're flying blind. Companies were reporting earnings that excluded one of their largest expenses. Imagine running a manufacturing company and not counting the cost of raw materials as an expense. That's essentially what was happening with options.\n\nThe Andersen case also shows how quickly institutional quality can deteriorate. It takes decades to build a reputation for integrity, but it can be destroyed in a few years when the wrong incentives take over. Once the PSG lost its authority, once the rainmakers were in charge, Andersen was on a path that led inevitably to its involvement in scandals and ultimately its destruction.\n\nThe broader lesson is about the importance of independence and proper incentives in any system of checks and balances. Auditors are supposed to work for shareholders, but they're hired and paid by management. That creates a fundamental conflict. The only way to manage that conflict is through strong professional standards and institutional structures that protect people who stand up for honest reporting. When those structures break down, when the people who bring in fees have more power than the people who maintain standards, you get exactly what we saw: a race to the bottom in accounting quality.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I pay so much attention to incentives. Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome. When auditors are incentivized to please management rather than serve shareholders, you get bad audits. When CEOs can award themselves huge option packages without showing the cost, you get excessive compensation. The Andersen story isn't just about one firm's failure – it's about what happens throughout corporate America when incentives become misaligned with the interests of owners."

If those statements don't reflect economic reality, if they're designed to flatter management rather than inform owners, then the entire system breaks down. It's that simple and that serious.\n\nLet me walk you through why the stock option battle mattered so much. When companies grant stock options to executives, they're giving away part of the business. If I own shares in a company and management grants options that dilute my ownership by 5%, I've just lost 5% of my stake in that enterprise. That's a real cost, as tangible as writing a check for salary. Yet for years, companies argued they shouldn't have to record this cost on their income statements. They'd expense the salary paid to the janitor, but not the far larger compensation paid to the CEO. It was absurd on its face.\n\nThe mechanics of how this corruption occurred tell you everything about what happens when corporate interests hijack accounting. FASB, the independent body charged with setting accounting standards, voted unanimously – seven to zero – that options should be expensed. This wasn't a close call among accounting experts. But CEOs who were gorging themselves on option grants knew that if the true cost appeared on the income statement, their boards might actually cut back on these obscene packages. So they did what powerful interests do: they went to Washington with their lobbyists and their corporate money – money belonging to shareholders, mind you – and they pressured the Senate to threaten FASB into submission.\n\nThe Senate voted 88-9 against expensing. Think about that. The Senate was voting on an accounting question, something they had no expertise in, overruling the unanimous decision of accounting experts. It would be like Congress voting on whether gravity exists. Arthur Levitt, who was SEC Chairman and normally a strong advocate for shareholders, caved to the pressure, and he's said it's his biggest regret. That's how corrupting this process was.\n\nWhat followed was predictable and disastrous. Once corporate America knew it could bully the accounting standard-setters, we entered what I called an era of \"anything-goes earnings reports.\" Companies knew they could push the envelope, and many did. This became fuel for the stock market bubble of the late 1990s. When earnings reports don't reflect reality, stock prices detach from underlying value, and you get the kind of speculation and eventual crash that hurts millions of people.\n\nHere's the broader point: capitalism depends on trust. Investors need to trust that the numbers they're seeing bear some relationship to economic reality. When that trust erodes – when CEOs are allowed to write their own report cards – capital gets misallocated, bubbles form, and eventually the whole system suffers. The option expensing battle wasn't some technical accounting dispute. It was a test of whether we'd maintain honest financial reporting, and for a time, we failed that test badly. The credibility that business leaders lost in that episode hasn't fully returned, and it won't until CEOs start treating their shareholders as partners rather than patsies."

And here's the key insight: if management is willing to cut corners or mislead you on things you can see, you can bet they're doing worse things you can't see.\n\nLet me explain the logic here. Accounting involves countless judgments and estimates. How do you value inventory? What assumptions do you use for pension returns? How do you recognize revenue? Do you expense stock options? In many of these areas, management has choices within the bounds of what's technically legal. Some choices paint a more accurate picture of economic reality. Others are designed to inflate reported earnings and make management look better.\n\nNow, when a CEO chooses the aggressive accounting treatment – the one that makes earnings look higher even though it's less reflective of reality – they're sending you a message. They're telling you that their priority is managing appearances rather than reporting truth. And this is where it gets really important: if they're willing to do this on matters that are visible to you in the financial statements, what do you think they're doing in areas you can't see?\n\nThink about stock option expensing. After FASB backed down and made expensing \"optional but preferred,\" 498 out of 500 companies in the S&P chose not to expense options. These companies were explicitly choosing the method that accounting experts said was less desirable, solely because it let them report higher earnings. That's not a technical decision – that's a character decision. Those CEOs were saying, \"We'd rather mislead our owners about our true costs than report honestly.\"\n\nThe same principle applies to pension accounting. Companies make assumptions about what returns their pension funds will earn, and these assumptions directly affect reported earnings. If a company assumes its pension will earn 9% or 10% annually when more realistic assumptions would be 6% or 7%, they're understating their true pension costs and overstating their earnings. It's legal, but it's dishonest. And again, it tells you something about the people running the company.\n\nI've seen this pattern play out over decades. Companies that are aggressive in their accounting almost always have other problems lurking beneath the surface. Maybe they're not being straight with their board. Maybe they're making poor capital allocation decisions but hiding them with accounting gimmicks. Maybe they're running the company for their own benefit rather than shareholders' benefit. The weak accounting is usually just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis is why I tell investors to watch out for these red flags. You don't need to be an accounting expert to spot them. Does the company expense options? Are the pension assumptions reasonable compared to other companies? Does management's discussion of earnings focus on GAAP numbers or do they constantly push \"adjusted\" earnings that exclude various costs? These are visible signals of management's integrity.\n\nThe practical lesson is straightforward: avoid companies with weak accounting. There are plenty of well-managed companies with conservative accounting run by people who want to give you an honest picture of the business. Why would you invest with people who are trying to fool you? Life's too short, and the investment universe is too large, to waste time on companies where management is playing games with the numbers. When someone shows you who they are through their accounting choices, believe them – and invest elsewhere."

        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons I can share with investors, and it goes straight to the heart of management integrity. When you see one accounting irregularity or one instance of management playing games with the numbers, you should assume there are many more problems lurking beneath the surface. It's exactly like finding a cockroach in your kitchen – if you see one scurrying across the floor, you can bet there are hundreds more hiding in the walls.\n\nThe reason this principle is so reliable comes down to human nature and organizational culture. A company's accounting choices reflect dozens, even hundreds, of decisions made throughout the year. Management decides how to handle stock options, what assumptions to use for pension plans, how aggressively to recognize revenue, how to present non-GAAP metrics, and countless other matters. Now, if management is willing to cut corners or mislead shareholders on the items you can see – the ones that are disclosed in the financial statements – what do you think they're doing with all the decisions you can't see?\n\nLet me give you a concrete example from the text. When a company trumpets EBITDA and tries to convince you that depreciation isn't a real expense because it's \"non-cash,\" they're essentially lying to you. Think about the analogy I used: imagine a company that pays all its employees for ten years of work upfront. In years two through ten, that compensation would be non-cash too, just a reduction of a prepaid asset. Would anyone seriously argue that's not a real expense? Of course not. The cash went out the door, and the fact that you paid it early doesn't make it any less real.\n\nWhen management makes this kind of transparently misleading argument about EBITDA, they're telling you something crucial about their character. They're showing you they're willing to insult your intelligence and distort economic reality to make their results look better. And here's the key insight: if they're doing this in plain sight, in the financial statements that auditors review and regulators examine, what are they doing in vendor negotiations, customer contracts, or internal controls where nobody's watching?\n\nThe same principle applies to unintelligible footnotes. I mentioned that Enron's descriptions of certain transactions still baffle me, and I've been reading financial statements for over sixty years. When a footnote is incomprehensible, it's almost never because the transaction is so sophisticated that it defies clear explanation. It's because management doesn't want you to understand. They're deliberately obscuring the truth, and again, that's a character issue that permeates everything they do.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I spend so much time evaluating management integrity. We're not just buying financial statements; we're buying into a relationship with the people running the business. If those people show you they're willing to shade the truth, play accounting games, or hide behind complexity, you should run the other direction. There are plenty of honest managers out there running good businesses. Why would you ever invest with someone who's already shown you they can't be trusted?"

        "value": "This is a question that gets to the fundamental nature of how businesses actually operate versus how many people wish they operated. When I see a CEO who consistently makes quarterly or annual earnings predictions and then hits those numbers quarter after quarter, year after year, I don't think \"Wow, what a great manager.\" I think \"Wow, what creative accounting,\" or worse, \"What numbers are being manufactured?\"\n\nLet me explain why this predictability is actually a red flag. Charlie and I have been running businesses for decades, and we own a diverse collection of excellent companies with strong competitive positions and talented managers. Yet we don't know what these businesses will earn next quarter, and we don't even pretend to know what they'll earn next year. Why? Because businesses operate in a dynamic, unpredictable world. Customer preferences shift, competitors make unexpected moves, suppliers face disruptions, weather affects operations, economic conditions change, and a thousand other variables come into play.\n\nThink about it logically. If businesses really did operate in a \"tranquil, no-surprise environment,\" as I sarcastically put it, then maybe earnings could advance smoothly. But that's not reality. One of our businesses might lose a major customer. Another might win a big contract. A third might face unexpected cost pressures. These things don't happen on a predictable schedule that allows you to forecast earnings to the penny. The real world is messy and uncertain.\n\nSo when a company consistently hits its earnings targets, one of two things is happening. Either they're setting absurdly easy targets that they know they can beat – which means they're playing games with expectations rather than maximizing value – or they're manipulating the numbers to match whatever target they previously announced. Neither scenario is good for shareholders.\n\nThe manipulation can take many forms. Maybe they're pulling revenue forward from next quarter, or pushing expenses into the following period. Perhaps they're playing games with reserves, releasing them when earnings are light and building them when times are good. They might be making unrealistic assumptions about pension returns or bad debt reserves. The specific techniques don't really matter. What matters is that managers who promise to \"make the numbers\" will eventually be tempted to \"make up the numbers.\"\n\nThis gets back to the character issue I discussed earlier. When a CEO stands up and makes a specific earnings prediction, they're putting their credibility on the line. As the quarter progresses, if it becomes clear they're going to miss that target, they face a choice. They can admit they were wrong, disappoint the market, and watch their stock price fall. Or they can find creative ways to massage the numbers to hit the target. The pressure to choose the second option is enormous, especially when their compensation is tied to hitting those targets.\n\nInvestment bankers love to show smooth, steadily increasing earnings projections in their offering books because it makes businesses look safe and predictable. But that's fantasy. Real businesses have lumpy earnings. They have good years and bad years, strong quarters and weak quarters. That's not a sign of poor management; it's a sign of honest reporting.\n\nWhat Charlie and I want are managers who tell us the truth about business conditions, who make decisions based on long-term value creation rather than short-term earnings management, and who have the integrity to report results honestly even when they're disappointing. We'd much rather have variable but honest earnings than smooth but manipulated ones."
