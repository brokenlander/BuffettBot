        "value": "The paradox you're asking about is one of the most important lessons in all of investing, and it's really quite remarkable when you think about it. American business has been an extraordinary wealth-creating machine over these 35 years. Corporate America delivered terrific results, as I mentioned. All an investor had to do was buy a diversified basket of American businesses through an index fund, pay very little in fees, and then – and this is the hard part – do nothing. Just sit there. Don't touch it. And yet, despite this simple recipe for success, many investors achieved results ranging from mediocre to disastrous.\n\nThe problem isn't intellectual; it's emotional and behavioral. I identified three primary causes, and they're worth examining carefully because they reveal fundamental truths about human nature and investing.\n\nFirst, there are high costs. When investors trade excessively, they're essentially paying a tax on their returns through commissions, bid-ask spreads, and market impact. It's like running on a treadmill that's tilted against you. And when they pay far too much for investment management – often 1% or 2% annually, plus performance fees – they're giving away a huge chunk of their returns before they even start. Remember, if the market returns 11% and you're paying 2% in fees, you've just surrendered nearly 20% of your gains. Over time, that compounds devastatingly against you.\n\nSecond, portfolio decisions based on tips and fads rather than thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses. This is where people abandon rational analysis and start acting on hot tips from their brother-in-law or chasing whatever sector is currently fashionable. They're not thinking about what businesses are actually worth; they're following the crowd. It's the difference between investing and speculating, between thinking and reacting.\n\nThird, and perhaps most damaging, is the start-and-stop approach. Investors enter the market after an advance has been long underway – when they're feeling confident because prices have been rising and everyone around them is making money. Then they exit after periods of stagnation or decline, when they're feeling pessimistic and scared. This is exactly backwards. They're buying high and selling low, the opposite of what creates wealth.\n\nWhat makes this so insidious is that these behaviors feel right in the moment. Trading feels active and smart. Following hot tips feels like you're getting an edge. Buying after the market has risen feels safe because it's been working. Selling after a decline feels prudent because you're \"cutting your losses.\" But these instincts, which might serve us well in other areas of life, are poison in investing.\n\nThe solution I described – buying an index fund and never touching it – requires you to do nothing during periods when doing something feels absolutely essential. It requires you to ignore your emotions, your friends' advice, and the financial media's constant drumbeat of urgency. That's why something so simple is so difficult. The enemy isn't complexity; it's our own psychology."

How should shareholders think about periods when Berkshire holds large cash positions, and what does this reveal about your approach to capital allocation?"
      },

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Let me be direct about this: sitting on $43 billion in cash equivalents represented a failure on my part to find productive uses for your capital. I don't sugarcoat that. My job is to deploy Berkshire's resources in ways that increase per-share intrinsic value faster than you could achieve by simply buying an index fund. When I can't do that, I'm not earning my keep.\n\nBut this situation reveals something important about how Charlie and I think about capital allocation, and it's worth understanding the principles involved. We will not deploy capital just to deploy capital. We won't make acquisitions or investments simply because we have money burning a hole in our pocket. The opportunity cost of a bad decision is enormous – not just the money we lose, but the opportunity we've foreclosed by tying up capital in something mediocre when something wonderful might come along next month.\n\nThink about what I was looking for in 2004: multi-billion dollar acquisitions that would add new and significant streams of earnings to what we already have. That's a high bar, and it should be. We're not looking for adequate businesses at fair prices; we're looking for wonderful businesses at sensible prices. When we can't find them, we wait. This discipline is essential to long-term success, even though it means sometimes looking foolish in the short term.\n\nNow, you might ask: why not just return the cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks? It's a fair question. The reason we hold onto it is that we believe – and this is a judgment call where we could be wrong – that opportunities will emerge where we can deploy large amounts of capital at attractive rates of return. When markets get frothy and deals are expensive, we build up cash. When opportunities appear, we want to be in a position to act decisively and quickly.\n\nThis connects to how our equity holdings have changed as a percentage of net worth. We went from an average of 114% in the 1980s to less than 50% in recent years. This shift means that yearly stock market movements affect a smaller portion of our net worth. In practical terms, we'll tend to underperform in strong up markets and overperform when markets fall. That's not a bug; it's a feature of how we're now structured, with large operating businesses generating cash alongside our investment portfolio.\n\nThe CEOs of our operating businesses understand their role perfectly. I tell them to run their business as if it were the only asset their family would own over the next hundred years. They do exactly that, and after taking care of their business needs, they send excess cash to Omaha for me to deploy. In 2004, they did their job brilliantly. I didn't do mine as well.\n\nHere's the key point for shareholders: our long-term performance versus the S&P is what matters. Any given year is just noise. You can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost. Unless Charlie and I achieve gains in per-share intrinsic value that outdo the S&P over time, we're adding nothing to what you can accomplish on your own. That's the standard we hold ourselves to, and periods of large cash holdings are times when we're acknowledging that we can't currently meet that standard by deploying the cash. It's honest, it's disciplined, and over the long term, it's the right approach – even when it's frustrating in the moment."

        "value": "You mention three primary causes of poor investor results: high costs, decisions based on tips and fads, and poor market timing. Why do these seemingly obvious mistakes continue to plague investors, and how should thoughtful investors approach the market differently?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "These three mistakes persist because they're rooted in human nature, and human nature doesn't change. Let me walk you through why each one is so destructive and what you can do about it.\n\nFirst, on costs: most investors simply don't grasp how devastating expenses are over time. If you're paying 2% annually in management fees plus trading costs, and the market returns 10% over the long term, you're giving up roughly 20% of your returns. Over thirty years, that difference compounds into an enormous gap in wealth. The financial services industry has every incentive to keep this obscured because they're collecting those fees. They'll talk about their expertise, their research capabilities, their market insights—anything to justify the costs. But here's the reality: most of them can't beat a simple index fund, and after their fees, almost none of them do. Excessive trading is particularly insidious because it feels like action, like you're doing something smart. But every trade has costs, and more importantly, it usually reflects an investor abandoning a previous decision. If you were right the first time, why are you selling? If you were wrong, why did you buy? This constant activity is the enemy of good results.\n\nSecond, tips and fads are tempting because they promise easy money and come with compelling stories. Someone tells you about a hot stock at a cocktail party, or you read about the latest technology that's going to change everything. The problem is that by the time something becomes a hot tip or a fad, it's usually already priced to reflect enormous optimism. You're not evaluating what the business is actually worth—you're just hoping someone will pay you more than you paid. That's not investing; that's speculation. Real investing requires you to thoughtfully evaluate what a business is worth based on its fundamentals: what it earns, what it will likely earn in the future, what assets it has, and what price you're paying relative to those factors. This takes work. It's not exciting. But it's what produces good results.\n\nThird, the timing problem is perhaps the most psychologically difficult to overcome. When markets have been rising for years and everyone around you is making money, it feels safe to jump in. When markets have fallen and the news is terrible, it feels dangerous to invest. But this is exactly backward. You want to be buying when assets are cheap, which is when things look scary, and you want to be cautious when assets are expensive, which is when everyone feels great. This is why I say be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\n\nThe solution to all three problems is the same: adopt a business-owner mentality. If you owned a farm or an apartment building, you wouldn't check its value every day or sell it because someone gave you a tip about a different property. You'd evaluate what it produces, what you paid for it, and whether those economics make sense. Do the same with stocks. Buy pieces of good businesses at reasonable prices, minimize your costs, and hold them for the long term. It's simple, but simple doesn't mean easy when your emotions are involved."

        "value": "Charlie and I have always operated on a simple principle: we should give our shareholders the information and analysis we'd want if our positions were reversed. That sounds straightforward, but it's actually quite different from how most companies approach reporting. Let me explain our thinking.\n\nThe fundamental challenge is that Berkshire has become enormously complex. We own insurance companies, utilities, railroads, manufacturers, retailers, and dozens of other businesses with vastly different economic characteristics. If you just look at our consolidated financial statements—which lump everything together according to accounting rules—you really can't understand what's going on. The jumble of figures obscures more than it reveals. An insurance company's balance sheet looks nothing like a railroad's balance sheet, and their income statements reflect completely different business models. Combining them into one set of numbers makes detailed analysis almost impossible.\n\nSo we break things down into major categories and give you the key information about each. We want you to understand the economics of our different businesses: how much capital they require, what returns they generate, how they use debt, and what their prospects are. This is the information that actually matters if you're trying to estimate Berkshire's intrinsic value, which is what a thoughtful owner should care about.\n\nBut here's the critical part: we also deliberately avoid burying you in data that doesn't help you understand the business. Many companies seem to believe that more disclosure equals better disclosure. They'll give you hundreds of pages of detailed breakdowns, segment information, and footnotes that create an illusion of transparency while actually making it harder to see what matters. It's like the old joke about the lawyer who buries the opposition in documents—technically everything is disclosed, but good luck finding the important stuff.\n\nOur approach is to give you the information that counts and explain it in plain English. Take the MidAmerican situation I described. The accounting rules require us to report it in an abbreviated manner because of our limited voting interest under PUHCA. But you need to understand what we actually own, how the business works, and particularly how debt is used in that business. Utilities can appropriately carry substantial debt because they have stable, regulated returns. That debt isn't and never will be an obligation of Berkshire itself. These are the facts that matter for understanding our risk and value.\n\nI also want to be honest about limitations and uncertainties. If accounting rules might change, I'll tell you. If we face regulatory constraints, you should know about them. If a business has challenges, we'll discuss them. This isn't just about being nice—it's about treating our shareholders as the partners they are.\n\nThe broader principle here is that good communication requires judgment about what's important. You have to understand your business well enough to know which metrics actually drive value and which ones are just noise. You have to respect your audience enough to explain things clearly rather than hiding behind jargon or complexity. And you have to be willing to admit what you don't know or what might change.\n\nMost corporate communications fail because management either doesn't truly understand their own business, or they're trying to manage perceptions rather than convey reality. We're trying to do the opposite: help you understand Berkshire the way we understand it, with all its complexity but also with clarity about what really matters."

        "value": "The key is having a managerial mindset that's willing to do what almost no other public company will do – and that's to walk away from business when the price isn't right, even if it means watching your revenues decline year after year after year.\n\nLet me explain why this is so difficult and so rare. Most insurance companies are trapped by their own structure and incentives. They've got a sales force to feed, overhead to cover, and Wall Street expectations to meet. When prices get competitive – and in insurance, they always do eventually – these companies face a terrible choice. They can either maintain their underwriting discipline and watch their revenues shrink, or they can keep writing business at inadequate prices just to keep the premium dollars flowing in. Almost invariably, they choose the latter. It's just human nature. Nobody wants to tell their sales force to go home, their investors that revenues are dropping, or their employees that there might be layoffs.\n\nBut here's what they're missing: In the insurance business, writing policies at inadequate prices is far worse than writing no business at all. When you write a policy for less than it costs you to provide the coverage, you're not just failing to make money – you're actually paying for the privilege of taking on risk. You're taking in, say, 95 cents of premium and promising to pay out a dollar of claims. And remember, you're doing this with float – money that doesn't belong to you. So you're essentially borrowing money at a terrible rate and calling it revenue growth.\n\nNICO understood something fundamental: In insurance, you make your money by underwriting, not by accumulating premium volume. From 1986 through 1999, NICO's revenue declined because we simply refused to write business at inadequate prices. Can you imagine a public company today telling Wall Street, \"We're going to let our revenues decline for thirteen consecutive years because we're being disciplined about pricing\"? They'd be crucified. The CEO would be out on his ear.\n\nBut that discipline is precisely what created value. While our competitors were writing business at a loss – paying for float instead of being paid for it – we were sitting on the sidelines, keeping our powder dry. When prices eventually firmed up, as they always do in insurance, we were there with capital and capacity while others were licking their wounds from years of underwriting losses.\n\nThis connects to a broader principle that applies far beyond insurance: The ability to say \"no\" is one of the most valuable competitive advantages any business can have. Most companies are organized around saying \"yes\" – yes to growth, yes to market share, yes to keeping busy. But in a commodity business, the discipline to say \"no\" when the price isn't right is what separates the great businesses from the mediocre ones. It requires patience, financial strength, and most importantly, a management team and ownership structure that can withstand the criticism that comes with watching revenues decline while competitors are bragging about their growth."

        "value": "The cost of float is everything in the insurance business, and understanding this is absolutely central to understanding why Berkshire's insurance operations have been so valuable. Let me walk you through the mathematics and the logic, because this is really the key to the whole thing.\n\nFloat is money we hold temporarily – it's our policyholders' money, not ours. We get to invest it, and we keep the investment income. But we have to pay it back when claims come due. So the question becomes: What does it cost us to have the use of that money? That cost is determined entirely by our underwriting results.\n\nIf we pay out more in losses and expenses than we collect in premiums, we're paying for the float. If we collect $100 million in premiums but pay out $105 million in losses and expenses, we've essentially paid $5 million for the use of that $100 million of float – that's a 5% cost. If we can invest that float and earn more than 5%, we still come out ahead, but we're starting from behind.\n\nBut here's where it gets really interesting: When we achieve an underwriting profit – when we collect more in premiums than we pay out in losses and expenses – the float is actually better than free. We're being paid to hold other people's money. If we collect $100 million in premiums and only pay out $95 million in losses and expenses, we've made $5 million on the underwriting and we still get to invest the $100 million and keep all the investment income. It's like getting a loan where the bank pays you interest to borrow their money.\n\nNow, scale this up to $46.1 billion of float, and you can see why this matters so much. If we can generate that float at zero cost – breaking even on underwriting – we have $46.1 billion to invest with no cost of capital. That's an enormous competitive advantage. We can buy businesses, stocks, bonds, whatever we think makes sense, and we keep all the returns. Most financial institutions have to pay for their capital – banks pay interest on deposits, investment firms have overhead and management fees. We get ours for free if we underwrite at breakeven, and we get paid if we underwrite at a profit.\n\nThe property-casualty industry as a whole almost never achieves this. In aggregate, insurers operate at an underwriting loss, which means they're paying for their float. They're only profitable if their investment income exceeds their underwriting losses. That's a much tougher business model, and it's why most insurers earn mediocre returns on equity.\n\nOur ability to generate low-cost or no-cost float comes back to that discipline I mentioned earlier. We're willing to shrink when prices are inadequate, which means we're not constantly refilling our bucket with expensive float. And when we do write business, we're maniacally focused on underwriting discipline – on making sure that the premiums we charge are adequate for the risks we're taking on.\n\nThis is why I said that without NICO, Berkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today. That $46.1 billion of float, generated at low or no cost over decades, has been an enormous engine of value creation. It's given us permanent capital to deploy, and it's done so without the constraints that most financial institutions face. That's a beautiful business model, but it only works if you have the discipline to keep the cost of float low."

      },

        "value": "The answer comes down to a fundamental principle that separates rational business management from what I call the \"institutional imperative\"—that lemming-like tendency of companies to mindlessly pursue activity and growth regardless of profitability. At National Indemnity, we were willing to shrink dramatically because we understood that it's better to do no business than to do bad business at inadequate prices.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. In insurance, you're taking in premiums today and promising to pay claims tomorrow. If you misprice that promise—if you charge $90 for something that will cost you $100 to deliver—you're not making money, you're losing it. It's that simple. Now, the insidious thing about insurance is that those losses don't show up immediately. You can write a terrible policy today, collect the premium, report it as revenue, and the full cost might not become apparent for years. This creates a dangerous illusion of profitability that can seduce management into thinking they're doing fine when they're actually destroying value.\n\nDuring that 1986-1999 period, billions of premium dollars were absolutely available to us. We could have maintained or grown our revenue anytime we wanted. But our competitors were pricing business at levels that made no economic sense. They were, in effect, selling dollar bills for ninety cents and calling it business development. We refused to play that game. We consistently priced to make a profit, not to match the most optimistic—or should I say delusional—competitor in the market.\n\nNow, think about what this means for a CEO reporting to shareholders. Quarter after quarter, year after year, you're standing up and saying, \"Our revenue declined again.\" Most CEOs can't stomach that. The institutional imperative kicks in—the tendency within organizations to resist change, to imitate competitors, to keep doing what you've been doing regardless of whether it makes sense. There's enormous pressure from all directions: employees want to stay busy, salespeople want commissions, Wall Street wants growth, and the CEO's ego wants expansion.\n\nBut here's what matters: we kept our underwriting discipline, and look at those profit margins during the decline years. Even as revenue fell, we maintained positive or only moderately negative underwriting results in most years. We weren't just shrinking—we were protecting our capital and waiting for rationality to return to the market. And when it did return, starting around 2001 after 9/11 shocked the industry into better pricing, we were ready. Our revenue went from $54 million in 1999 to over $600 million by 2004, and we did it profitably because we had the infrastructure, the expertise, and most importantly, the capital that we'd preserved by not squandering it during the irrational years.\n\nThe lesson is this: in any business, but especially in insurance, you must be willing to walk away from business that doesn't make sense. Revenue is not the same as profit, and activity is not the same as achievement."

        "value": "The delayed consequences in insurance create one of the most dangerous traps in business—the ability to fool yourself into thinking you're profitable when you're actually heading toward disaster. Let me explain exactly how this works and why it's so seductive.\n\nWhen an insurance company writes a policy, there's a fundamental time lag between collecting the premium and paying out claims. You might collect a premium in January 2005, but the claim might not occur until 2006, might not be reported to you until 2007, and might not be fully settled until 2009 or beyond. During all that time, you need to estimate what those future claims will cost and set aside reserves—money to pay those claims when they come due.\n\nHere's where the self-deception enters. If you're an optimistic manager—or worse, a dishonest one—you can assume that claims will be lower than they're likely to be. You set aside insufficient reserves. In the short term, this makes your reported earnings look wonderful because you're recognizing premium revenue today while understating the costs you'll face tomorrow. Your income statement looks great, your growth looks impressive, and everyone's happy. The CEO gets bonuses, the stock price rises, and the business appears to be thriving.\n\nBut here's the brutal reality: eventually, those claims come in. Eventually, you have to pay them. And when the true costs reveal themselves—sometimes years later—you discover that the profits you reported were a mirage. You weren't making money; you were just deferring the recognition of losses. This is precisely what nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970s. They were growing rapidly, reporting profits, and then discovered their reserves were woefully inadequate. The company came to the brink of insolvency.\n\nNow connect this to the pricing discipline question. Imagine you're running an insurance company and the market turns soft—competitors start cutting prices. You have a choice: match those prices and keep your revenue up, or maintain rational pricing and watch your business shrink. If you match the low prices, you can tell yourself a story: \"Maybe we can make it work with better claims management,\" or \"Perhaps loss costs will be favorable this year,\" or \"Our competitors must know something we don't.\" You keep writing business, your revenue stays strong, and if you're optimistic in your reserving, your profits look fine too. It might be three, four, five years before the truth emerges.\n\nThis is why the institutional imperative is so powerful in insurance. The pain of shrinking is immediate and visible—you see it in every quarterly report. But the pain of mispricing is delayed and hidden. It takes enormous discipline and courage to choose the visible, immediate pain of declining revenue over the hidden, delayed pain of underwriting losses.\n\nAt National Indemnity, we chose reality over illusion. Look at those numbers again: from 1982 through 1984, we were actually showing underwriting losses even as we shrank, because we were honest about our reserves. We didn't play games with the numbers. And notice how our expense ratio—the cost of running the operation—went up during the lean years as a percentage of premiums, because we were spreading our fixed costs over less revenue. We could have easily masked all of this by writing more business at inadequate prices and reserving optimistically.\n\nThe key insight is this: in insurance, you can appear to be a genius for years while actually being a fool. The only protection against this self-deception is rigorous honesty in reserving and absolute discipline in pricing. You have to be willing to face the truth, even when the truth is uncomfortable and even when your competitors seem to be prospering by ignoring it."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The fundamental problem is that insurance companies face a perfect storm of psychological and organizational pressures that make rational behavior extraordinarily difficult. You see, when pricing deteriorates in the insurance market, the logical response is to write less business or even stop writing altogether. But this creates an immediate and visible problem: shrinking revenue, idle employees, and unhappy distribution partners. The rational long-term decision looks like failure in the short term, and that's a very hard pill for most managers to swallow.\n\nLet me walk you through why this happens. First, there's what I call the fear factor. When business volume drops, employees naturally worry about their jobs. They're not being malicious or stupid – they're being human. So they start rationalizing why the company should accept poorly-priced business. They'll tell themselves and their bosses that they need to maintain relationships with agents and brokers, that they need to keep the organization intact, that a recovery is just around the corner and the company needs to be positioned to participate in it. Every one of these arguments sounds reasonable in isolation, but they're all really just elaborate justifications for doing something that will lose money.\n\nThe Tom Murphy story I mentioned illustrates the deeper problem perfectly. When that employee asked to hire an assistant for $20,000 a year, he was thinking about an incremental cost. But Tom correctly framed it as a $3 million lifetime decision. Once you hire someone, it's extremely difficult to let them go unless the company faces dire circumstances. This creates a ratchet effect – headcount goes up easily but comes down hard. So companies that don't maintain discipline about hiring when times are good find themselves overstaffed when markets turn, which intensifies the pressure to write bad business just to keep people busy.\n\nNow, here's what makes NICO different. We made a simple but powerful promise: no one will be fired because of declining volume. This removes the fear factor entirely. Our employees don't have to rationalize writing bad business to save their jobs because their jobs aren't threatened by doing the right thing. They can watch our volume shrink by 80% or 90% if necessary, and they know they'll still be employed. This aligns their interests with the company's long-term interests perfectly.\n\nBut – and this is crucial – this policy only works if you're careful about not overstaffing in the first place. NICO isn't labor-intensive, so we can afford to carry some excess overhead during lean times. We absolutely cannot afford to write underpriced business, because once that discipline breaks down, it rarely comes back. An organization that doesn't care about underwriting profit this year won't suddenly care next year.\n\nThe real test of this approach is emotional, not intellectual. Anyone can look at a table showing years of declining volume and understand the logic in about thirty seconds. But living it day after day, watching competitors grow and get praised by Wall Street while you're shrinking – that takes real fortitude. It has to be embedded deep in the company's culture. NICO has had four CEOs since 1940, and not one of them has bent. That's the kind of institutional backbone that's rare in business."

        "value": "Insurance is fundamentally a business built on estimates and guesses, and that's precisely why discipline matters so much. When we report our underwriting results for any given year, we're really making our best estimate about how that year will ultimately turn out. We won't know the true results for years, sometimes decades. This uncertainty creates enormous opportunities for self-deception, which makes it absolutely essential to maintain rigorous standards about what business you're willing to write.\n\nLet me explain the two main sources of uncertainty. First, we have IBNR – incurred but not reported claims. These are losses that have already happened but haven't been reported to us yet. At year-end, we have to estimate how many of these claims will eventually show up and what they'll cost. We're essentially predicting the future based on patterns from the past, and while we can be pretty accurate in aggregate, there's always uncertainty.\n\nSecond, many claims take years or even decades to settle. Think about that for a moment. We might write a policy in 2004, receive a claim in 2006, and not fully settle it until 2020 or beyond. During those years, all sorts of surprises can emerge. Medical costs might inflate faster than expected. Legal precedents might change, expanding our liability. New information about the claim might surface. Each of these surprises can significantly change the ultimate cost of that claim.\n\nThis is why I noted that profit margins for years through 1999 are probably close to correct – those years are \"mature\" with few claims still outstanding. But the more recent the year, the more guesswork is involved. The results shown for 2003 and 2004 are apt to change significantly. We're reporting numbers, but they're really educated guesses that will be refined over time.\n\nNow here's why this uncertainty makes underwriting discipline so critical. If you write business at inadequate prices, you're making a bet that your estimates are wrong in your favor. You're hoping that claims will come in lighter than expected, that settlement costs will be lower than projected, that inflation will be benign. Sometimes you'll get lucky. But over time, the math catches up with you. Inadequate prices lead to underwriting losses, period.\n\nThe insidious part is that the feedback loop is so slow. If you write bad business in 2004, you might not realize how bad it was until 2008 or 2010 or even later. By then, you've written several more years of similarly bad business. The losses compound, and by the time the problem becomes undeniable, you've dug yourself a very deep hole. This is why I say an insurance organization that doesn't care deeply about underwriting at a profit this year is unlikely to care next year either. The lack of discipline becomes habitual.\n\nThe uncertainty also creates opportunities for rationalization. When results are ambiguous and won't be known for years, it's easy to convince yourself that your pricing is adequate, that your estimates are conservative, that you're smarter than the market. Wall Street rewards growth and punishes shrinkage, so there's enormous pressure to keep writing business and to present an optimistic picture of your reserves and profitability.\n\nThis is why NICO's approach is so valuable. By removing the pressure to grow, by accepting that volume will shrink dramatically when prices are inadequate, we eliminate the incentive to fool ourselves. We can look at the pricing in the market, compare it to what we need to make a profit, and simply walk away when the numbers don't work. The uncertainty in insurance results doesn't go away, but we don't compound it by writing business we shouldn't write in the first place."

        "value": "The ability to watch your business shrink while maintaining discipline is one of the rarest and most valuable traits in management, and it goes right to the heart of what separates truly exceptional managers from the merely competent ones. Most managers simply cannot do what Don does at NICO, and understanding why tells you everything about human nature and business incentives.\n\nLet me walk you through the psychology here. When you're running a business and your competitors are growing, they're getting written up in the trade press, they're being celebrated at industry conferences, and Wall Street analysts are praising their market share gains. Meanwhile, you're sitting there watching your volume decline, quarter after quarter. The pressure is immense. Your own employees start questioning the strategy. Board members get nervous. Your ego takes a beating every time you see a competitor's growth announcement. It takes extraordinary fortitude to stick to your guns.\n\nBut here's what makes Don special and why Charlie and I applaud louder as his volume drops: he understands that in the insurance business, bad growth is worse than no growth. Much worse. When insurance prices fall below the level needed to cover future claims and expenses, every policy you write is a liability, not an asset. You're literally paying customers to take your product. Don knows that float is only valuable if it comes at a low or negative cost. If you're paying 6% or 8% or 10% for your float by underpricing policies, you'd be better off not writing the business at all.\n\nThis connects to something fundamental about business management. Most managers are wired to equate growth with success. It's how they've been trained, it's how they're compensated, and it's how they're judged by their peers. Declining volume feels like failure, even when it's the smartest possible move. The institutional imperative, as I've called it, pushes managers to mindlessly imitate their competitors. If everyone else is growing, the pressure to grow becomes almost irresistible.\n\nWhat separates great managers like Don is that they're playing a different game entirely. They're not trying to impress Wall Street or win market share awards. They're trying to maximize the long-term value of the business. Don understands that his job is to write good business at good prices, and when good prices aren't available, to have the courage to walk away. That's why I used the Barry Bonds analogy. Barry was willing to take a walk rather than swing at a bad pitch, even though walks aren't as exciting as home runs. Don does the same thing.\n\nThe note about our four NICO CEOs and only one being a college graduate is important too. Business ability of this caliber is largely innate. You can't teach someone to have the emotional fortitude to shrink their business while competitors boom. Either they have that inner compass or they don't. Don has it in spades, and that's why we've accumulated $950 million of negative-cost float at NICO. That discipline, that willingness to be unpopular and contrarian, has created enormous value for Berkshire shareholders over decades."

        "value": "The evolution from the bureau system to State Farm to GEICO is a perfect case study in how capitalism works and how competitive advantages can be built and then surpassed in commodity businesses. It shows that even when you think you've got an unbeatable position, there's often someone thinking about how to do it even better and cheaper.\n\nLet's start with the original bureau system. The major insurers had essentially created a cartel. They set prices high, competed on agent relationships rather than price, and everyone made comfortable profits. The agents made high commissions, the insurers made good money, and the only people getting a bad deal were the consumers who were paying inflated prices. But here's the thing about umbrellas in business: they're wonderful if you're holding one, but they create enormous opportunities for anyone willing to get a little wet.\n\nGeorge Mecherle saw that umbrella and thought, \"Why should I pay independent agents who play companies off against each other?\" His captive agent model at State Farm cut distribution costs dramatically. Instead of agents representing multiple companies and demanding high commissions, State Farm's agents worked for State Farm alone. This wasn't a small advantage; it was enormous. State Farm eventually captured 25% of the personal lines market, crushing competitors who had seemed invincible. The magic of capitalism was working exactly as it should, rewarding the low-cost operator.\n\nBut then Leo Goodwin asked an even better question: \"Why do we need agents at all?\" This is the kind of fundamental thinking that creates real breakthroughs. Auto insurance was mandatory, the product was standardized, and most consumers knew what coverage they needed. The agent wasn't adding value proportionate to their cost. By going direct to consumers, GEICO could undercut even State Farm's low-cost structure.\n\nNow, here's what's crucial to understand about low-cost advantages in commodity businesses. When you're selling a commodity product, something where customers can't easily distinguish between competitors, price becomes the dominant factor. If I can deliver the same product as you but charge less because my costs are lower, I will gradually take your customers. It's that simple. But you have to really be the low-cost operator, not just claim to be. And you have to pursue that advantage relentlessly.\n\nThat's why I said GEICO must pursue an \"unrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy.\" When you have a cost advantage in a commodity business, you can't get complacent. You have to keep pushing, keep growing, keep taking market share. Unlike NICO, where the ebb-and-flow model makes sense because we don't have a structural cost advantage, GEICO has something precious: a genuinely lower cost structure than competitors. We'd be foolish not to exploit that advantage to the maximum.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about the power of asking fundamental questions about business models. The bureau insurers never questioned whether their distribution system made sense. State Farm questioned it and won big. Then GEICO questioned State Farm's model and found an even better answer. Each time, the innovation came from someone willing to challenge conventional wisdom and think from first principles about what customers actually needed and what costs were truly necessary. That kind of thinking is rare, but when you find it or can implement it, you've got something that can compound value for decades."

        "value": "This is a really important distinction that people often miss, and I'm glad you're asking about it because the two things – America's economic strength and the dollar's weakness – seem contradictory at first glance, but they're actually quite different matters.\n\nLet me start with the fundamental point: America has the strongest economy in the world, bar none. We have a system that works remarkably well – market economics, rule of law, equality of opportunity. These aren't just nice-sounding phrases; they're the bedrock of prosperity. Our productive capacity, our innovation, our entrepreneurial spirit – all of these remain unmatched. That's not changing, and that's not what I'm worried about.\n\nThe dollar problem is entirely different. It's not about our ability to produce goods and services. It's about our consumption patterns relative to our production for export. Think of it this way: if you're a wonderfully productive person earning $100,000 a year, but you're spending $150,000 a year, you've got a problem. It doesn't mean you're not talented or productive. It means you're living beyond your means, and eventually that catches up with you.\n\nThat's what's happening with our trade deficit. We had $1.15 trillion in legitimate trade – goods and services exchanged both ways. That's wonderful, and the more of that, the better for everyone involved. True trade is enormously beneficial. But then we purchased an additional $618 billion in goods and services that wasn't reciprocated. We're consuming more than we're producing for export, to the tune of $1.8 billion every single day.\n\nNow, in economics, there's always a balancing item. You can't just receive $618 billion in goods and services without giving something back. What we're giving back is ownership of America itself. Foreigners are accumulating IOUs from our institutions, or they're buying our assets – our stocks, our real estate, our businesses. Ten years before I wrote that letter, foreign net ownership of U.S. assets was negligible. By then, it was about $3 trillion, and it's been growing ever since.\n\nHere's the key insight: this is a policy choice, not an economic weakness. Our trade policies – and I'd argue our lack of attention to the consequences of persistent trade deficits – are creating this pressure on the dollar. That Congressional study I mentioned, all 318 pages examining the consequences of trade deficits, was published in November 2000 and promptly ignored. The deficit was $263 billion then, which seemed alarming. By the time I was writing, it had more than doubled to $618 billion. That's not benign neglect; that's dangerous neglect.\n\nSo we can have the world's most productive economy while simultaneously transferring ownership of that economy to foreign interests at an alarming rate. The economy's strength doesn't protect the currency when policies allow for massive, sustained imbalances. That's why Charlie and I positioned Berkshire in foreign currencies – not because we've lost faith in America, but because we understand that current policies are creating predictable pressure on the dollar, and we have a fiduciary duty to protect our shareholders from that entirely foreseeable consequence."

        "value": "Let me break this down step by step, because understanding this mechanism is crucial to grasping what's happening to American wealth, and it's not complicated once you see the basic arithmetic.\n\nStart with what real trade looks like. When we engage in true trade, both sides benefit. We sell Boeing aircraft to other countries, they sell us electronics or clothing or whatever they produce efficiently. Money flows both directions, goods flow both directions, and both countries end up better off. That $1.15 trillion in genuine trade we had? That's wonderful. That's wealth creation for everyone involved.\n\nBut then we have this additional $618 billion where we're buying goods and services from abroad without selling them anything in return. Now, you might ask, \"How is that even possible? How do we pay for it?\" And that's where the wealth transfer comes in.\n\nSee, in economics, the books always have to balance. If we're receiving $618 billion more in goods and services than we're sending out, something else has to flow in the opposite direction to make up the difference. That something is ownership of American assets. It happens in one of two ways, and both amount to the same thing.\n\nFirst, we can give foreigners IOUs. Our government issues Treasury bonds, our corporations issue corporate bonds, our banks create obligations. Foreigners accumulate these claims on future American output. They're essentially saying, \"Fine, we'll send you goods now, and you promise to pay us back later, with interest.\" That's debt, and it means future American production will go to servicing those obligations rather than benefiting Americans.\n\nSecond, foreigners can buy existing American assets. They purchase our stocks, our real estate, our businesses. When a foreign entity buys an office building in Manhattan or a factory in Ohio or shares in American companies, they're acquiring ownership of the productive assets that generate wealth. The returns from those assets – the rents, the profits, the dividends – now flow to foreign owners instead of American owners.\n\nBoth paths lead to the same destination: Americans own less of America, and foreigners own more. We're literally transferring ownership of our country at the rate of $1.8 billion per day. That's not a figure of speech or an abstraction. That's actual wealth, actual ownership, actually changing hands.\n\nThink about what this means over time. A decade before I wrote that letter, foreign net ownership of U.S. assets was essentially zero. By then, it was $3 trillion. That's $3 trillion worth of American assets generating returns for foreign owners instead of American owners. Every year going forward, the dividends, interest, and rents on those assets flow overseas.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: there's nothing wrong with foreign investment per se. When foreigners invest in building new factories here or starting new businesses, that's capital formation, and it's beneficial. But that's not what's happening here. We're not talking about foreigners investing in new productive capacity. We're talking about them accumulating claims on existing American wealth because we're consuming more than we're producing for export.\n\nThe real concern is that this process feeds on itself. As foreigners accumulate more dollar-denominated assets, they become increasingly reluctant to hold dollars, which puts more pressure on the currency. If the dollar declines significantly or disorderly, we could see political and financial spillover effects that are difficult to predict but potentially serious. We're conducting an experiment in how long the world's reserve currency can sustain massive, persistent deficits, and nobody really knows how it ends. That's why Charlie and I felt compelled to position Berkshire defensively, despite our fundamental optimism about America's economic strength."

A budget deficit is essentially an argument among family members about how to divide up the family's pie. No matter how large our budget deficit gets, as long as we're borrowing from ourselves – from other Americans – one hundred percent of what we produce still belongs to us as a nation. We might argue fiercely about who should pay more taxes and who should receive government benefits. We might have heated debates about Social Security, Medicare, defense spending, or any other government program. These are real and important arguments, but they're arguments about redistribution among Americans. When the dust settles and all the political fighting is done, every bit of our national output remains here for Americans to consume or invest. Nobody outside the family gets a slice.\n\nCurrent account deficits work entirely differently, and this is where the real danger lies. When we run large and persistent current account deficits – which primarily reflect our trade deficit – we're consuming more than we produce. We're buying more from other countries than they're buying from us. How do we pay for this overconsumption? We do it by selling off pieces of America. We sell them stocks, bonds, real estate, and businesses. Over time, foreigners accumulate claims on our assets and our future production.\n\nThink about it like a family that consistently spends more than it earns. At first, they might sell some furniture or jewelry to make up the difference. Then maybe they take out loans against their house. Eventually, the finance company owns more and more of what that family produces through their labor. They're working harder and harder, but an increasing share of their paycheck goes to servicing debt rather than improving their own lives.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening to America with current account deficits. A decade ago, foreign net ownership of the U.S. was negligible. Now it's about three trillion dollars. If we continue on this path, in another decade it could reach eleven trillion dollars. At a modest five percent return, we'd be sending five hundred and fifty billion dollars abroad every year – about three percent of our projected GDP – just as a royalty payment for our past overconsumption.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from budget deficits because this wealth actually leaves the country. It's not a redistribution among Americans; it's a transfer from Americans to foreigners. And unlike budget deficits, which can be addressed through domestic policy changes, this foreign ownership doesn't disappear unless we dramatically change our consumption patterns and run large trade surpluses for years. The sons really do pay for the sins of their fathers in this case. Americans will still live well because our economy will grow, but we'll increasingly be working for foreign owners rather than ourselves, and that will create enormous political tension."

Throughout history, conquered nations paid tribute to their conquerors. We're not being conquered militarily, of course, but we're voluntarily putting ourselves in a position where we'll be paying a perpetual royalty to the rest of the world. That should alarm people far more than it does.\n\nLet me walk through why this matters so much. First, understand the permanence of the problem. When I say we'd be sending three percent of GDP abroad, that's not a one-time payment. It's an annual obligation that continues year after year after year. It's like having a permanent tax that doesn't fund our roads, our schools, our defense, or our social programs. Instead, it funds consumption and investment in other countries. That three percent represents goods and services that Americans produce but don't get to enjoy.\n\nNow, three percent might not sound catastrophic. Americans would still have ninety-seven percent of what we produce, and since our economy will be larger in a decade, we'd still be living better than we do today in absolute terms. But here's what really concerns me: the psychological and political implications of this arrangement. Americans are not going to be happy about perpetually working for foreign creditors and owners. We're going to chafe at it. We're going to resent it. And that resentment could lead to some very bad policy decisions.\n\nThink about the political dynamics this creates. When times get tough economically – and they will at some point – politicians will look for scapegoats. It's much easier to blame foreign owners and creditors than to admit we did this to ourselves through overconsumption. We could see protectionist policies, threats to default on obligations, or other measures that would damage our credibility and our economy far more than the tribute itself. The international tensions this could create are genuinely worrying.\n\nThere's also the compounding nature of the problem. That eleven trillion in foreign ownership I mentioned assumes we just continue current trends. But if we don't change course, why would the trend stop at a decade? The hole keeps getting deeper. The royalty payments keep growing. At some point, you reach a level where the burden becomes truly unsustainable, where we're forced into a painful adjustment whether we want it or not.\n\nWhat really troubles me is how little public understanding there is of this issue. People hear about trade deficits and their eyes glaze over. Politicians talk about both budget and trade deficits as if they're the same thing, which they absolutely are not. The media doesn't do a good job explaining the difference. So we keep consuming more than we produce, keep selling off pieces of America, and keep building up this obligation to pay tribute to the rest of the world.\n\nThe solution isn't pleasant to contemplate either. To reverse this trend, we'd need to consume less than we produce for years, running trade surpluses to buy back what we've sold. That means a lower standard of living during the adjustment period. The longer we wait, the more painful that adjustment becomes. It's like any addiction – the longer you indulge, the harder it is to break the habit and the more painful the withdrawal.\n\nThis is why I keep coming back to this issue. We're making a choice, largely unconsciously, to burden future generations with obligations that will constrain their options and reduce their wealth. That strikes me as profoundly unfair and ultimately unsustainable."

The difference between trading product for product versus wealth for product is the difference between sustainable prosperity and gradual impoverishment, even if that impoverishment happens from a very high level.\n\nLet me walk you through this carefully. When two countries trade product for product, they're both using their labor and resources to create things of value, then exchanging them. If Japan makes cars more efficiently than we do, and we grow soybeans more efficiently than they do, we both benefit by specializing and trading. That's classic comparative advantage. Both countries are working, producing, and consuming in rough balance. Nobody's getting poorer in the transaction.\n\nBut that's not what we're doing. We're running a $600 billion current-account deficit, which means we're consuming $600 billion more than we're producing. To pay for this overconsumption, we're not sending products abroad – we're sending IOUs and ownership stakes in American assets. We're selling off pieces of the farm, as I put it in the text.\n\nNow, why does this matter? Think about it at the family level first, because the principle is identical. Imagine a family that earns $50,000 a year but spends $60,000. To cover the difference, they sell off a little bit of their house, their car, their furniture every single year. In year one, they're living great – better than their income would suggest. In year five, they're still living well. But eventually, they own less and less of their assets, and more importantly, they owe more and more to others. The payments on their debts start consuming their income. They've become sharecroppers on their own property.\n\nThat's the path we're on as a nation. Every year we run these massive deficits, foreigners accumulate more claims on American assets and more bonds that we must pay interest on. This creates a perpetual royalty payment flowing out of the country. Even if our economy grows and Americans continue to live well in absolute terms, we're transferring an ever-larger share of our output to foreign creditors and owners.\n\nThe political implications are profound. Americans have always seen themselves as owners, not tenants. We're talking about becoming an \"Ownership Society,\" but our trade policies are creating the opposite. When a significant portion of American output must be sent abroad to service our debts and pay returns to foreign owners, that's going to create enormous resentment. We'll chafe at paying tribute, even if we're still relatively prosperous.\n\nThe structural problem is that this can't self-correct easily. A gently declining dollar hasn't fixed it. Hoping other countries will inflate their economies or that Americans will suddenly save more misses the point. We need either significant policy changes or a dollar decline sharp enough to potentially disrupt financial markets. Neither option is pleasant, but continuing on the current path leads us toward that sharecropper status – and that's simply not sustainable politically or economically for a great nation."

The asymmetry exists because we've somehow convinced ourselves that running massive deficits is a sign of economic strength or free-market virtue, when in reality we're enabling other countries to pursue the very mercantilist policies we claim to oppose.\n\nLet me explain what's really happening here. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that held sway for centuries before Adam Smith discredited it. Mercantilist countries tried to run perpetual trade surpluses, accumulating gold and treasure while exporting more than they imported. It was ultimately a beggar-thy-neighbor policy that Smith showed was economically foolish – trade should benefit both parties, not enrich one at the expense of the other.\n\nNow, if America were running a $600 billion surplus, the world would be absolutely right to condemn it. We'd be sucking demand out of the global economy, forcing other countries into deficit positions, accumulating massive claims on foreign assets, and essentially requiring the rest of the world to go into debt to us. That would be classic mercantilism, and it would be wrong.\n\nBut here's the thing – that's exactly what the rest of the world is doing to us, just in reverse. They're running the surpluses, we're running the deficits. They're accumulating the claims on assets, we're selling them off. They're becoming the creditors, we're becoming the debtors. In effect if not in intent, as I said, they're practicing mercantilism toward the United States.\n\nWhy has this been allowed to persist? Several reasons. First, we have a vast store of assets to sell. America is wealthy, and we've built up centuries of accumulated capital, property, and productive capacity. We can run these deficits for quite a while before we've sold off enough to really feel the pinch. It's like a rich family living beyond its means – they can do it for years by gradually liquidating their wealth.\n\nSecond, we have a pristine credit history. The world trusts U.S. government bonds and dollar-denominated assets. This trust allows us to continue borrowing on favorable terms, which enables the deficit to continue. We're like a borrower with a perfect credit score – lenders keep extending us credit even as our debt grows.\n\nThird, and this is crucial, there's been a bipartisan political consensus supporting these policies. Republicans and Democrats alike have championed trade agreements and policies that facilitate these deficits. There's been no serious political constituency pushing back, partly because the negative effects are gradual and partly because cheap imports provide immediate benefits to consumers while the costs are diffused and long-term.\n\nFourth, policymakers and financial luminaries keep hoping for a soft landing. They acknowledge the problem in principle – even the Federal Reserve minutes I cited admit these deficits can't persist indefinitely – but then they offer no substantive solutions. They hope for a gently declining dollar, they counsel other countries to stimulate their economies, they urge Americans to save more. These are band-aids on a structural problem.\n\nThe real issue is that we've created a comfortable arrangement for everyone in the short term. Other countries get to run their export-led growth models, building up their industries and employment. Americans get to consume more than we produce, enjoying a higher material standard of living than our output alone would provide. But this arrangement has a built-in expiration date, and the longer it continues, the more painful the eventual adjustment will be."

        "value": "The answer comes down to how Charlie and I think about our responsibilities as stewards of Berkshire's capital. We manage Berkshire as if we owned 100% of it ourselves, and that changes everything about how you make decisions.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When you own something entirely, you can't fool yourself. There's no one else to blame, no way to hide behind what everyone else is doing. If we personally owned all of Berkshire and watched the dollar declining significantly while we sat there doing nothing, we'd feel pretty foolish even if nobody else noticed. The loss would be real, the mistake would be real, and the fact that it was a conventional mistake wouldn't make us any richer.\n\nNow, here's where Keynes's observation becomes so important. He understood human nature perfectly. In the investment world, there's enormous pressure to do what everyone else is doing. If you're a money manager and you lose money the same way everyone else lost money, well, you keep your job. Your clients might be unhappy, but they can't really blame you. You followed best practices. You did what any reasonable person would do. But if you do something different and it doesn't work out, even if the conventional approach would have lost just as much money, you look like a fool. You took an unnecessary risk. You were arrogant enough to think you knew better. That's why Keynes talked about lemmings – the individual lemming never gets criticized even as the whole class runs off the cliff together.\n\nThis dynamic creates a terrible incentive structure. It encourages money managers to make decisions based on how they'll look rather than what will produce the best results. And that's exactly backwards from how we think about things at Berkshire.\n\nWhen we looked at the currency situation, we saw the U.S. running massive current-account deficits, essentially using our credit card denominated in our own currency to an extent no other country could get away with. We're rich junkies, as I put it, and the world has been willing to finance our spending because of our vast assets and pristine credit history. But we didn't think that could continue indefinitely. The math just doesn't work.\n\nSo we had a choice. We could keep all our assets in dollars, which would be the conventional thing to do. If the dollar declined, we'd lose money, but so would everyone else who kept their assets in dollars. No one would criticize us. Or we could take positions in foreign currencies, which would be unconventional. If we were wrong, everyone would see it and we'd look foolish for taking an unnecessary risk.\n\nBut here's the thing – we're not managing money to protect our reputations. We're managing it to protect and grow the wealth of Berkshire's shareholders. And when you think about it that way, the choice becomes clear. We believed the dollar was likely to decline, so we acted on that belief, even though it meant our mistakes would be very public if we were wrong.\n\nThat's what it means to manage as if you own 100% of the business. You make the decisions you'd make if it were all your own money, regardless of how it looks to others. Reputation is important, but it should be a byproduct of making good decisions, not the primary consideration driving those decisions."

Let me be clear from the start: Charlie and I readily admit that macroeconomics is a tough game. We haven't demonstrated any special skill in it, and we may well be wrong about the currency situation. That's not false modesty – it's just reality.\n\nBut here's what people often misunderstand: not making a decision is itself a decision. If we kept all of Berkshire's assets in dollars, that wouldn't be a neutral position. That would be a very large bet that the dollar would maintain or increase its value relative to other currencies. The fact that it's the conventional position doesn't make it any less of a bet.\n\nSo the real question isn't whether to make a bet on currencies – you're making that bet whether you realize it or not. The question is whether to make it consciously and deliberately, or to make it by default. We chose to make it consciously.\n\nNow, let me explain why the fact that many pundits were predicting dollar weakness made us uneasy. In investing, when everyone agrees on something, it often means that view is already fully reflected in prices. If everybody thinks the dollar will fall, then people have already positioned themselves for that outcome. They've already bought foreign currencies or foreign assets. At that point, you need to ask yourself: what new information or event would cause the dollar to fall further? And if something unexpected happens that's positive for the dollar, you could see a sharp reversal as all those consensus trades unwind.\n\nThis is why investing is so difficult. You need to think independently, but you also need to be humble enough to recognize that when you're going against the crowd, you might be wrong. And when you're with the crowd, you might be in a crowded trade that's vulnerable to reversal. There's no comfortable position.\n\nSo how do we handle this? First, we size our positions appropriately. We didn't put all of Berkshire's assets into foreign currencies. We made a significant commitment, but not one that would be catastrophic if we were wrong. Second, we stay focused on the fundamentals that drove our decision in the first place. The U.S. was running enormous current-account deficits. We were consuming more than we produced and financing the difference by, in effect, issuing IOUs denominated in our own currency. That fundamental imbalance had to resolve somehow, and we thought it was more likely to resolve through a weaker dollar than through other mechanisms.\n\nThird, we're honest about our uncertainty. Notice that I said we \"hope\" the U.S. adopts policies to reduce the current-account deficit, even though that would likely cause us to record losses on our foreign-exchange contracts. That tells you something important: we're not so wedded to being right that we'd rather see bad outcomes for the country just to make money on our positions. We'd rather be wrong and see the problem solved than be right and see it fester.\n\nThis gets at a deeper point about how we think about Berkshire's interests. Yes, we made currency bets based on our view of the likely direction of the dollar. But Berkshire's resources remain heavily concentrated in dollar-based assets. Our businesses operate primarily in the U.S. We benefit enormously from a strong dollar and a low-inflation environment. So we're not currency speculators trying to maximize profits on these trades. We're business owners trying to prudently manage our exposure to what we saw as a significant risk.\n\nThe bottom line is this: you can't avoid uncertainty in investing. You can only decide whether to acknowledge it honestly and act thoughtfully despite it, or to pretend it doesn't exist by sticking with conventional positions. We chose the former, knowing full well we might be wrong, but believing it was the right approach for Berkshire's owners."

Everything else is just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic if you get these fundamentals wrong.\n\nLet me walk you through why each question is critical. First, having the right CEO is absolutely paramount because that person makes hundreds of decisions every year that compound over time. A great CEO will allocate capital wisely, build the right culture, and create enormous value. A poor CEO will destroy value no matter how perfect your governance checklist looks. The difference between a good CEO and a bad one isn't 10% or 20%—it can be the difference between a company that multiplies in value and one that withers away. Yet I see institutional investors spending more time worrying about whether the board has the right committee structure than whether they have the right person running the show.\n\nThe second question about compensation matters because it reveals whether the CEO and board are treating the business like it's their own money or someone else's. When compensation gets out of hand, it's not just the dollars going out the door—though those matter. It's what that excess reveals about the mindset of the people in charge. Are they thinking like owners or are they thinking like hired hands trying to grab what they can? Overreaching on compensation is often a symptom of a deeper problem: a board that can't say no to the CEO and a CEO who's lost sight of the fact that he's working for the shareholders.\n\nThe third question about acquisitions is where the most value gets created or destroyed in corporate America. Most acquisitions don't work. The CEO gets excited, investment bankers whisper sweet nothings about synergies, and suddenly the company is paying a huge premium for another business. The board nods along because they don't want to seem unsupportive. But the math often doesn't work, and shareholders end up paying a dollar to get eighty cents of value. This happens over and over because nobody with real ownership stakes is willing to stand up and ask the tough questions.\n\nNow contrast this with what institutional investors typically focus on. They'll have long debates about board independence or whether directors should serve on too many boards or the latest governance fad. These things aren't completely unimportant, but they're second-order issues at best. The absurdity of the situation became clear to me when some institutions decided I wasn't \"independent\" enough to serve on Coca-Cola's board, despite having billions of Berkshire's dollars invested there. They were following a checklist rather than thinking about whether my presence helped or hurt shareholders.\n\nThe problem is that focusing on checklists is easier than making tough judgments about CEO quality, fair compensation, or acquisition wisdom. It's easier to measure whether a board has the right percentage of independent directors than to evaluate whether the CEO is making smart capital allocation decisions. But easy doesn't mean important. If institutional investors would spend their energy on these three questions and speak up forcefully when they see problems, they'd do far more good for their beneficiaries than all the checklist governance reforms combined."

Even at Berkshire, with our exceptional managers and our culture of trust, we need formal mechanisms to surface problems that might otherwise stay hidden.\n\nLet me start with the executive sessions without the CEO present. I've sat on nineteen boards over the years, and I can tell you that the dynamic in a boardroom changes completely when the CEO leaves. It's not that CEOs are tyrants—most aren't. It's that their mere presence affects the conversation. Directors are human beings, and human beings don't like confrontation. They don't want to seem unsupportive or negative. They worry about relationships. So dubious plans get polite questions instead of hard scrutiny. CEO performance issues get rationalized rather than addressed. This happens even with strong, independent directors who have the shareholders' interests at heart.\n\nWhen the CEO steps out, directors can speak more freely. They can say \"I'm really worried about this acquisition\" or \"I don't think our CEO is the right person for the next phase\" without the awkwardness of saying it to the person's face. This isn't about being sneaky or underhanded—it's about creating a space where directors can fulfill their duty to shareholders without the natural human discomfort that comes from direct confrontation. In several situations I witnessed over the years, having these sessions would have led to better decisions and, in a few cases, necessary CEO changes that happened years later than they should have.\n\nThe whistleblower line addresses a different but related problem, one that's particularly acute at Berkshire given our extreme decentralization. We have 180,000 employees spread across dozens of businesses. I've compared it to a sprawling city, and in a city that size, not every sparrow that falls gets noticed at headquarters. That's generally fine—our decentralization is a huge strength. But it also means that problems can fester at subsidiaries without Charlie or me knowing about them.\n\nMost of the complaints we get through the whistleblower line are trivial, as I mentioned. But occasionally we learn about serious issues involving personnel or business practices that wouldn't show up in any audit. These are the kinds of problems where someone on the ground knows something is wrong, but they're afraid to speak up through normal channels. Maybe their boss is the problem. Maybe they worry about retaliation. Maybe they just don't think anyone would listen. The whistleblower line gives them a direct path to me and the audit committee, and it's led me to important problems I otherwise would have missed entirely.\n\nWhat both of these reforms teach us is that even the best organizational structure has blind spots. Berkshire's decentralization works wonderfully for empowering great managers and avoiding bureaucracy, but it can also hide problems. Our culture of trust and autonomy is a tremendous asset, but it doesn't eliminate the human dynamics that make bad news hard to deliver. You can have the right people, the right structure, and the right culture, and you still need formal mechanisms to catch what falls through the cracks.\n\nI fault myself for not recognizing this sooner. I think I believed that if we had good people and treated them right, everything else would take care of itself. That's mostly true, but not completely true. These reforms don't contradict our decentralized structure or our trust in managers—they complement them. They're safety valves that make the whole system work better. Berkshire would be more valuable today if I'd put them in place decades ago, and that's a lesson I learned too late but one I'm glad we finally implemented."

Real independence isn't about checking boxes on a form—it's about understanding where someone's genuine economic interests lie.\n\nLet me walk you through the arithmetic, because it's really quite simple. Berkshire owned $8 billion worth of Coke stock. Meanwhile, our subsidiaries like McLane and Dairy Queen bought some Coke products in the normal course of business. Now, the institutions worried that these routine purchases might somehow compromise my judgment. But think about the incentives here. Any profit Berkshire might make from its business dealings with Coke would be trivial—maybe we'd make a few basis points on product sales. Compare that to $8 billion in stock ownership. If I did anything to harm Coke's business or its shareholders, I'd be shooting myself in the foot to the tune of billions of dollars to maybe pick up thousands in business profits. You'd have to think I'm not just conflicted but actually stupid to believe I'd sacrifice the larger interest for the smaller one.\n\nThis is where Jesus got it exactly right two thousand years ago: \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" It's not poetry—it's a precise description of human nature and incentives. Your treasure, your real economic stake, determines where your loyalty lies. The protesting institutions wanted to apply some abstract standard of independence while ignoring this fundamental truth about human behavior.\n\nNow let's look at what real alignment looks like at Berkshire. Every one of our directors has at least $4 million of their own family's money invested in Berkshire stock. They didn't get these shares through options or grants—they bought them with their own capital. The board fees they receive are a tiny fraction of their annual income, so they're not dependent on staying in management's good graces to pay their mortgages. And here's something else: we don't carry liability insurance for directors. They're traveling the same road as shareholders, with their own wealth on the line.\n\nCharlie and I have sat on many boards over the years, and I can tell you that the directors most often classified as \"independent\" under corporate governance rules are frequently the least independent in practice. These are often people who collect $200,000 or $300,000 a year in board fees across multiple companies. That's their livelihood. They're hoping to get recommended for additional board seats to increase their income further. Now, these are generally decent, honorable people doing good work. But they're human. When a decision comes up that might threaten their board position or their reputation in the director community, can you really expect them to be as independent as someone whose primary economic stake is as a fellow shareholder? Their treasure—their annual income—depends on staying on that board. That's where their heart will be when the tough decisions come.\n\nThe current system of corporate governance has confused the appearance of independence with the reality of it. True independence comes from having your economic interests aligned with shareholders, not from being distant from the company's operations."

The problem isn't that directors who depend on board fees are bad people—most are smart, accomplished, and well-intentioned. The problem is that we've created a system that puts them in a position where their personal financial interests can diverge from shareholders' interests at critical moments.\n\nLet me explain how this works in practice. A typical \"independent\" director might serve on three or four boards, collecting $200,000 to $300,000 per board. That's $800,000 to $1.2 million a year, which for many people represents their primary income, especially in retirement. They've built a nice life around these board seats. Now, here's the key question: What happens when management proposes something that's good for management but questionable for shareholders?\n\nThe director faces a real dilemma. If they make waves, challenge management too aggressively, or get a reputation as difficult, they might not get recommended for re-election. Worse, they might not get invited to join other boards. The corporate director community is relatively small, and reputations matter. CEOs talk to each other. Search firms keep track of who's \"constructive\" and who's \"problematic.\" A director who consistently challenges management might find their board seats dwindling, and with them, their income.\n\nI alluded to a specific example in my comments—an acquisition proposal I had first-hand knowledge of where management wanted to proceed, the investment banker blessed it, and it was set to go forward at a price above where the stock had traded. Now, I didn't name the company, but the circumstantial evidence was telling. The board approved this deal even though, in retrospect, it clearly wasn't in shareholders' best interests. The stock never again reached that proposed acquisition price. Why would a board turn down a premium offer? Because management didn't want to sell. And directors who depend on their board fees weren't going to force the issue.\n\nThis is where the \"treasure\" principle becomes so important. If a director's treasure—their primary economic stake—is their board fees, that's where their heart will be. They'll be thinking, consciously or unconsciously, about preserving their position. But if their treasure is a large shareholding in the company, everything changes. They'll push back on management when necessary because their own wealth is on the line.\n\nCharlie and I have seen this pattern repeatedly over decades of board service. The most independent thinking often comes from directors who own substantial stock and for whom board fees are insignificant. They can afford to be unpopular with management because they're not dependent on the income. They can push for a sale of the company if that's the right answer, even if management opposes it, because their economic interest is aligned with shareholders, not with preserving management's jobs or their own board seats.\n\nThe current regulatory approach to independence focuses on things like whether a director has business relationships with the company or family connections to management. These factors matter, but they miss the bigger point. A director with no business ties to the company but who depends on board fees for their lifestyle faces a powerful conflict of interest that the regulations largely ignore. We've created a system that certifies people as independent based on formal criteria while overlooking the fundamental question of where their economic incentives actually lie. That's why you see boards approving excessive CEO compensation, rejecting reasonable acquisition offers, and generally being more supportive of management than shareholders would want. The directors aren't corrupt—they're just responding rationally to their own incentive structure."

Here you had directors who blocked shareholders from even seeing a multi-billion dollar offer that was above where the stock had traded for years, yet these same directors wouldn't buy shares for themselves at far lower prices. That tells you everything you need to know about their true motivations.\n\nThe problem is that we've confused the definition of independence. The stock exchanges and regulators define a director as independent if they don't have certain business relationships with the company. But that's not real independence. Real independence means your financial interests are aligned with shareholders, not with keeping your board seat. When a director is collecting $100,000 a year in fees and owns virtually no stock except what the company gave them, where do you think their loyalty lies? As Matthew 6:21 says, \"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\" Their treasure was in those director fees, not in the stock price.\n\nThink about the incentives at work here. If this acquisition had gone through, those board seats would have disappeared. No more $100,000 annual payments. No more committee fees. No more prestige of being on a public company board. Meanwhile, the shareholders would have received a price well above market value for their shares. But the shareholders never got that choice because the directors made it for them.\n\nWhat makes this particularly galling is the timing. At the very same meeting where they rejected the acquisition proposal, these directors voted themselves a pay increase. You can't make this stuff up. They're saying to shareholders, \"We don't think you should be allowed to sell your shares at this premium price, but we do think we should get paid more for making that decision on your behalf.\"\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something. I don't know for certain what motivated each director who opposed the deal. And here's the insidious thing about conflicts of interest: the directors themselves probably don't know either. Self-interest doesn't usually announce itself. People are remarkably good at convincing themselves that what's good for them is also the right thing to do. They'll come up with all sorts of strategic rationales for why the deal wasn't right, why shareholders would be better off with the long-term plan, why the price wasn't adequate despite being above market. But the reality is that self-interest inevitably blurs introspection.\n\nThe solution isn't complicated. Directors should own significant amounts of stock purchased with their own money. Not options, not restricted stock grants, but shares they bought in the open market. When directors have real skin in the game, when their personal wealth rises and falls with the stock price, you get very different behavior. They start thinking like owners because they are owners. At Berkshire, our directors receive nominal fees but they own substantial amounts of stock. That's real alignment, and that's what produces decisions that truly serve shareholder interests."

All of the Big Four accounting firms agree options should be expensed. Every member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board agrees. Virtually all investment professionals agree. So who's on the other side? CEOs who don't want their reported earnings reduced, and the politicians they've lobbied. That tells you this isn't about accounting principles; it's about self-interest and political power.\n\nThe bill that passed the House 312-111 was truly breathtaking in its audacity. Here you had Congress trying to override the independent accounting standard-setters and mandate inferior accounting. Imagine if Congress decided to pass a law saying gravity only counts on Tuesdays. That's essentially what they were doing with economic reality. Fortunately, Senator Shelby stopped it in the Senate, and Bill Donaldson at the SEC stood firm despite massive political pressure. But the fact that it got as far as it did should alarm every investor.\n\nLet's talk about what really happened here. CEOs who benefited enormously from options wrote checks to politicians. Those politicians then did their bidding by trying to prevent honest accounting. This happened in 1993, and when the FASB tried again to fix the problem, the CEOs muscled Congress a second time in 2004. This is corruption dressed up in business suits and campaign contributions. It's CEOs using shareholder money to lobby for rules that let them hide how much shareholder money they're taking.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize something important: nobody is trying to restrict the use of options. Not the FASB, not investors, not me. Options can be a perfectly legitimate form of compensation. If my successor at Berkshire gets paid partly through options, that's fine. But those options need to be structured properly with an appropriate strike price, with adjustments for retained earnings, and with restrictions on quick sales. And most importantly, they need to be recorded as the expense they truly are.\n\nThe proper structure matters enormously. If you give a CEO at-the-money options and the company simply retains earnings and grows book value, the CEO gets rich even if they've created no value whatsoever. That's not pay for performance; that's pay for showing up. Options should be structured so they only pay off when management creates real value above what shareholders could have earned by simply retaining the capital.\n\nWhat this entire episode reveals is how corporate governance really works in America. CEOs have enormous power to shape the rules under which they operate. They control the money that flows to politicians. They sit on each other's boards and compensation committees. They hire the consultants who recommend their pay packages. The whole system is designed by insiders for insiders. Shareholders are supposed to be the owners, but in practice, they're often treated as an inconvenience. The stock option accounting battle is just one example of this larger problem, but it's a telling one because the intellectual dishonesty required to defend non-expensing is so transparent."

The fight over expensing options has never been about whether companies can use them – it's about whether they should tell the truth about what they cost.\n\nHere's the fundamental issue: if something has value when you receive it, it has cost to the person giving it. When a company grants stock options to executives, those options have real value – that's the whole point! The executives certainly think they're valuable, or they wouldn't want them. So if they're valuable to the recipient, they're a cost to the company, and that cost should be reflected in the financial statements. It's really that simple. The resistance to expensing options comes from CEOs who understand that honest accounting would expose just how much they're really being paid and would likely result in their compensation being structured more rationally.\n\nNow, let me explain what I mean by logically-structured options, because this is important. At Berkshire, my successor may well receive options, but they'll be designed properly. First, the strike price needs to be appropriate – not some lowball number that guarantees a payout regardless of performance. Second, and this is crucial, the strike price should escalate to reflect retained earnings. If a company retains a dollar of earnings and doesn't pay it out as a dividend, shareholders should expect more than a dollar of value creation. The strike price should rise accordingly. Otherwise, managers get rewarded just for sitting on money that belongs to shareholders. Third, there should be a ban on quickly disposing of shares purchased through options. If we're trying to align management with long-term shareholder interests, we can't have executives cashing out the moment they exercise their options.\n\nThe real problem here is that certain CEOs know their compensation would look outrageous under honest accounting. They also suspect their stock prices might be lower if investors could clearly see the true cost of management compensation. So they're fighting expensing with everything they've got – and here's the kicker – they're using shareholder money to wage this fight. They're spending your money to lobby Congress and fight accounting rules that would reveal how much of your money they're taking. It's quite a racket when you think about it.\n\nThe argument that expensing options will reduce their use is nonsense. If options truly create value for shareholders, then recording their cost accurately shouldn't matter. Companies should be happy to show they're getting good value for what they're paying. The only reason to fear honest accounting is if you know the compensation isn't justified. We motivate our managers at Berkshire with various arrangements – sometimes cash bonuses, sometimes options – but we're always honest about what things cost. That's what shareholders deserve, and that's what honest accounting requires."

        "value": "This gets right to the heart of one of the most important issues in corporate governance – the agency problem. When you own a business outright, you make decisions with your own money and you live with the consequences. But in public companies, managers are making decisions with other people's money, and that creates a fundamental conflict of interest that requires constant vigilance.\n\nThink about what's happening with the option-expensing fight. CEOs are taking shareholder money – money that could be used for capital investments, dividends, or building the business – and they're spending it on lobbying efforts, PR campaigns, and legal fees to fight an accounting rule. And why? Not because it benefits shareholders, but because it benefits the CEOs personally. They want to keep their compensation packages looking smaller than they really are, and they want to avoid the scrutiny that would come with honest accounting. This is a perfect example of the agency problem in action.\n\nThe beauty of proper incentives is that they align the interests of managers with shareholders. That's why I'm not opposed to options per se – if they're structured correctly, they can be wonderful tools. But here's what's been happening: managers have figured out how to structure options that are heads-I-win, tails-you-lose propositions. They get strike prices that don't account for retained earnings, so they profit even if they're just mediocre stewards of capital. They get to exercise and sell quickly, so they can cash out before any long-term problems emerge. And they've fought tooth and nail to keep these options from being expensed, so shareholders don't fully understand the cost.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something: most managers are honest, decent people trying to do a good job. But the system has allowed some bad practices to flourish, and even good people can rationalize bad behavior when there's enough money at stake. When a CEO can make tens of millions of dollars extra by keeping accounting opaque, the temptation to fight transparency becomes enormous.\n\nThis is why I've always believed in treating shareholders like partners and communicating with complete honesty. At Berkshire, we try to give you the information we'd want if our positions were reversed. We don't use shareholder money to fight rules that would benefit shareholders. We don't lobby for special accounting treatment. We simply try to tell you the truth about our business and our costs, including compensation costs.\n\nThe solution to the agency problem isn't complicated in theory, though it's hard in practice. You need directors who truly represent shareholders, not management. You need compensation systems that genuinely align interests over the long term. You need transparency so shareholders can see what's really happening. And you need a culture where managers view themselves as stewards of other people's money, not as entitled to whatever they can grab.\n\nWhen I tell you to contact your Congressman and Senators about option expensing, I'm asking you to fight back against managers who are using your money against your interests. That shouldn't be necessary, but sometimes it is. Shareholders need to stand up for honest accounting and rational compensation, because you can be sure that CEOs benefiting from the current system will fight hard to preserve it."
