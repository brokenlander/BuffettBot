        "value": "Well, I'm being a bit modest there, but the underlying principle is absolutely serious and it's one of the most important things Charlie and I have learned about running Berkshire. The real insight is this: when you've got truly outstanding managers running businesses they understand deeply, your job isn't to manage them – it's to create the conditions where they can do their best work and then stay out of their way.\n\nLet me walk you through why this works. These managers – the Blumkins, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, and the others I mentioned – they were managerial stars long before we came along. They built their businesses through every kind of economic weather you can imagine. They know their customers, their competitors, their employees, and every nuance of their operations in ways that Charlie and I never could, even if we spent years trying to learn. When you've got that kind of expertise and that kind of track record, the worst thing you can do is start second-guessing their decisions or imposing some corporate playbook on them.\n\nThink about that golf analogy for a moment. If Jack Nicklaus is on your team, what could you possibly tell him about his swing that would help? He's spent his entire life perfecting his craft. He knows what works for him. Your job isn't to coach his swing – it's to make sure he's got good equipment, that he's playing on courses where he can succeed, and that he's not distracted by a bunch of nonsense from headquarters. The same applies to great business managers.\n\nNow, here's what makes this approach actually work rather than just being neglect dressed up as philosophy. First, we're very careful about who we partner with in the first place. We're looking for people who have demonstrated excellence over long periods, who have integrity, and who genuinely love their businesses. We're not buying turnarounds where we need to parachute in and fix things. Second, these managers think like owners because in many cases they were owners, and they continue to have that ownership mentality even after selling to us. That's the highest compliment I can pay – they treat every dollar of capital as if it were their own.\n\nThird, and this is crucial, they're not working for the money. As I mentioned, some are independently wealthy, but they keep working because they love what they do and they relish outstanding performance. That intrinsic motivation is worth more than any incentive system we could design. When someone is driven by the pure joy of excellence in their craft, you don't need to motivate them – you just need to not demotivate them with bureaucracy and interference.\n\nThe practical implication is profound: we've built Berkshire with essentially no corporate bureaucracy. We don't have strategic planning departments, human resources mandates from headquarters, or endless meetings and reports. Our headquarters staff could fit in a small office. This isn't because we're lazy – it's because we've learned that for truly exceptional managers, corporate overhead is pure friction. It slows them down and distracts them from what they do best.\n\nSo when do we step in? Mainly on capital allocation – that's really Charlie's and my primary job, which I'll get to in discussing our failures. But on operations? Almost never, unless we're specifically asked for help."

        "value": "This is one of the most important points in that whole letter, and I'm glad you picked up on it. Capital allocation is really the central job that Charlie and I have at Berkshire, and when we can't do it well, we're failing our managers and our shareholders, plain and simple. Let me explain why this matters so much and why it's genuinely difficult.\n\nHere's the fundamental issue: our operating managers are generating capital – they're producing earnings year after year without needing much additional investment in their businesses. As I noted, except for insurance, they're not utilizing much additional capital to grow their earnings dramatically. That's wonderful! It means they're running high-return businesses. But now that capital comes to Charlie and me, and we have to figure out what to do with it. We have essentially three choices: we can reinvest it in the existing businesses, we can buy new businesses, or we can buy securities. If we can't do any of those things intelligently, the cash just piles up, earning minimal returns.\n\nWhy is this a failure? Because of opportunity cost. When our managers generate a dollar of earnings, they've already demonstrated they can produce outstanding returns in their businesses. If I then take that dollar and let it sit idle, or deploy it at mediocre returns, I've destroyed value relative to what could have been achieved. It's like having a goose that lays golden eggs, and then taking those golden eggs and trading them for regular eggs. The managers did their job brilliantly – they gave us the gold – and then I fumbled it.\n\nThe difficulty in capital allocation comes from several sources. First, we're dealing with large amounts of money. Berkshire generates substantial cash flow, which means we can't just make small investments – we need to find opportunities that are big enough to move the needle. That immediately limits our universe of options. Second, we have standards. We're not going to deploy capital just to put it to work. We need to find businesses or securities that we understand, that are run by people we trust, and that are available at sensible prices. Sometimes – often, really – the market doesn't offer us anything that meets all those criteria.\n\nThird, there's a timing problem. The best opportunities tend to come along when other people are pessimistic or when there's chaos in the markets. But our managers are generating cash steadily, regardless of market conditions. So we might have capital burning a hole in our pocket during a roaring bull market when everything is overpriced. The disciplined response is to wait, but waiting means admitting you can't deploy the capital skillfully right now.\n\nHere's what makes this particularly frustrating: in 1986, our business value probably grew faster than our book value, largely because of the unrecorded goodwill our managers were building through their outstanding performance. They were creating economic value that doesn't show up on the balance sheet. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on capital that they generated, unable to find equally attractive places to put it to work. The contrast between their success and my inability to match it is stark.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about intellectual honesty and accountability. It would be easy to obscure this failure – to talk about how we're \"keeping our powder dry\" or \"maintaining strategic flexibility\" or some other corporate euphemism. But the truth is simpler: I had capital to deploy and I couldn't find sufficiently attractive opportunities. That's a failure of execution on my part, and shareholders deserve to know it.\n\nThe practical implication is that capital allocation is a distinct skill, separate from operating management. Our managers are world-class at running their businesses. That doesn't automatically make Charlie and me world-class at deploying the capital they generate. It's a different game, requiring different judgments, and in 1986, they were winning their game while I was struggling with mine."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The answer comes down to something quite simple: the quality of the people matters infinitely more than the quantity you're managing. Traditional management theory gets this backwards. They'll tell you that no executive should have more than five or seven direct reports, and they've got all these formulas and organizational charts. But that's nonsense if you're working with the right people.\n\nLet me explain why this works at Berkshire. When you have managers who truly think like owners, who are passionate about their businesses, and who possess high character, they simply don't create problems that need solving. They don't require hand-holding or constant supervision. They don't play political games or try to build empires. They don't need you to referee disputes or check their work. Instead, they run their businesses as if they owned them outright, which means they're making decisions the same way Charlie and I would make them.\n\nThe Catholic tailor story illustrates this perfectly. Here's a man so absorbed in his craft that even when meeting the Pope – the Pope! – he's evaluating the quality of the tailoring. That's the level of occupational passion we look for. When someone is that engaged with their work, management becomes almost unnecessary. They're self-directed, self-motivated, and self-correcting.\n\nNow contrast this with having even one person reporting to you who is deceitful, inept, or uninterested. That single person will consume enormous amounts of your time and energy. You'll be checking their work, cleaning up their mistakes, dealing with the problems they create with customers or other employees, and worrying about what they might do next. One bad manager can easily take up more of your time than a dozen good ones combined.\n\nThis is why David Ogilvy's advice about hiring people bigger than yourself is so crucial. If you hire people smaller than you – whether in ability, character, or ambition – you'll need to compensate for their deficiencies. You become the limiting factor for the entire organization. But if you hire people who are bigger than you in some dimensions, they elevate the entire enterprise. They don't need you to make them successful; they make you successful.\n\nThe practical implication is profound. Most companies organize themselves around the assumption that managers are interchangeable parts who need supervision and control. So they build elaborate hierarchies, create complex approval processes, and limit spans of control. But this is solving for the wrong problem. The real problem is that they've hired people who need all that supervision in the first place.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've inverted this. We could easily handle twice as many managers as we have now, not because Charlie and I are superhuman, but because our managers are exceptional. They free us up rather than bog us down. This gives us time to focus on capital allocation, which is really our main job. And yes, it leaves time for an afternoon nap, which at my age isn't such a bad thing either."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Capital allocation is the heart of what Charlie and I do, and understanding why it matters so much at Berkshire requires understanding some basic mathematics and their long-term implications. Let me walk you through this carefully because it's absolutely fundamental to how we think about the business.\n\nFirst, consider the three factors I mentioned: we earn more money than average, we retain all of it, and our businesses require little incremental capital to grow. Now, let's think about what this means in practice. If you're earning 23% annually on equity and retaining all of it, the compounding effect is enormous. Every dollar we misallocate today doesn't just cost us that dollar – it costs us that dollar compounded at high rates for years or decades to come. The opportunity cost is staggering.\n\nCompare this to a company earning 10% and paying out half as dividends. They're only retaining 5% of their net worth annually, so their capital allocation decisions, while still important, change the company's trajectory much more slowly. If they make a mediocre investment, it's unfortunate, but it doesn't dramatically alter their future. They have time to correct course.\n\nWe don't have that luxury – or perhaps more accurately, we have a much greater responsibility. When you're retaining 23% of net worth annually, you're doubling the capital base roughly every three years. If that capital gets deployed poorly, the economics of Berkshire will deteriorate very quickly, as I said in the letter. This isn't theoretical – it's mathematical certainty.\n\nNow add in another dimension: our major investees like GEICO and Capital Cities/ABC are also high-return businesses retaining their earnings. So we're not just responsible for allocating Berkshire's direct earnings, but we need to ensure that the companies we invest in are also allocating their retained earnings wisely. The compounding effect multiplies across multiple levels.\n\nHere's what keeps me up at night – or would, if I let it. Let's say we have a billion dollars to allocate. If we invest it in something earning 5%, we've essentially destroyed value, because we could have earned 23% keeping it in our existing businesses or finding something comparable. Over ten years, that billion at 5% becomes about $1.6 billion. But at 23%, it becomes over $8 billion. That's not a rounding error – that's the difference between success and failure for our shareholders.\n\nThis is why we're so selective, sometimes maddeningly so. People ask why we hold cash when we could be putting it to work. But putting capital to work in mediocre investments is far worse than holding cash temporarily. Cash is optionality – it's waiting for the fat pitch, as I like to say. A bad investment is a permanent impairment of our compounding machine.\n\nThe practical lesson here extends beyond Berkshire. Any investor or business owner needs to understand that the higher your returns and the more you retain, the more critical each allocation decision becomes. You can't afford to be casual about it. Every decision needs to be measured against your best alternative use of capital, and that bar should be high. For us, it's very high indeed, and that's exactly as it should be. The mathematics demand it, and our shareholders deserve nothing less."

        "value": "The mathematics of compounding work wonderfully when you're small, but they become your enemy as you grow large. Let me explain why this is such a fundamental issue for Berkshire and why I keep harping on it to our shareholders.\n\nWhen we talk about maintaining a 15% return on equity, you need to understand what that means in absolute dollar terms as our capital base expands. In 1986, achieving that 15% return meant we needed to add a certain amount to our net worth. But looking forward ten years from that point, I told shareholders we'd need to increase our net worth by $7.2 billion to maintain that same percentage return. That's not $7.2 billion total - that's $7.2 billion in addition to what we already had. The universe of opportunities that can move the needle on a number that large is dramatically smaller than when we were working with more modest sums.\n\nThink about it this way: if you're running a company that's only adding 5% to net worth annually, your capital allocation decisions still matter, but they change your economics slowly, almost glacially. You have time to correct mistakes, and even mediocre decisions won't sink you quickly. But at Berkshire, where we retain all our earnings and those of major investees like GEICO and Capital Cities/ABC, we're adding to our capital base at a much faster rate. If Charlie and I deploy those retained earnings unproductively, the economics of Berkshire will deteriorate very quickly - not slowly, but quickly.\n\nThe Fechheimer acquisition illustrates this problem perfectly. It's an excellent business run by exactly the kind of people we want to partner with - the economics are sound, the management is first-rate. But it only utilized about 2% of Berkshire's net worth. That's the cruel reality of size. A wonderful acquisition that would transform a smaller company barely registers on our results.\n\nIn 1986, we essentially paid off debt and stockpiled cash because we couldn't find adequate opportunities in marketable equities, an area where just a few years earlier we could readily employ large sums in outstanding businesses at very reasonable prices. Now, neither paying off debt nor stockpiling cash is a fate worse than death - they're perfectly sensible things to do when you lack better alternatives. But they don't move the needle, and they certainly don't inspire handsprings.\n\nThe honest truth is that if Charlie and I draw blanks for a few years in our capital allocation endeavors, Berkshire's rate of growth will slow significantly. We need not just good ideas, but very big and very good ideas. An acquisition has to be large to help our performance materially. Under the stock market conditions of that time, we had little hope of finding equities to buy for our insurance companies. Markets change, of course, and someday we'd get our turn at bat again, but we had no idea when.\n\nThis is why I keep telling shareholders that our returns are certain to drop substantially because of our enlarged size. It's simple mathematics, and no amount of management brilliance can fully overcome it."

In 1986, that meant paying off debt and stockpiling funds. Now, I'll be honest with you - these moves don't inspire handsprings. They're not exciting. They won't generate headlines or make us look like geniuses. But they preserve our capital and keep our powder dry for when opportunities do appear. The worst thing we could do is force capital into mediocre opportunities just because we feel pressure to \"do something\" with our money.\n\nYou see, there's an enormous temptation in the business world to be active. Managers feel they need to justify their existence by making deals, acquiring companies, or deploying capital in visible ways. Wall Street often encourages this - they want action, transactions, fees. But at Berkshire, our job isn't to be active; it's to be smart. Sometimes being smart means sitting on your hands and waiting.\n\nThis is why honesty with shareholders is so critical. I told our owners directly that under current stock market conditions, we had little hope of finding equities to buy for our insurance companies. I didn't sugarcoat it or pretend we had some secret pipeline of deals. Markets will change significantly - you can be sure of that - and someday we'll get our turn at bat again.

That's just the truth.\n\nI also kept hammering on the point about our returns being certain to drop substantially because of our enlarged size. I said it can't be said too often, even though I'm sure shareholders felt I'd tried. But this isn't pessimism - it's mathematics. When you need to increase net worth by $7.2 billion over ten years to maintain a 15% return, you need a few very big and very good ideas. Not just big, not just good, but both.\n\nThe alternative to this honesty would be to overpromise, to suggest that we can maintain historical returns regardless of size, or to deploy capital into subpar opportunities just to appear busy. Some managers do this because they're afraid of disappointing shareholders or seeing their stock price suffer. But that's incredibly short-sighted. If we put money into businesses earning 8% when we need 15%, we're destroying value over time, even if it makes the current year's numbers look more active.\n\nOur promise to shareholders is simple: we'll look for operating businesses that meet our tests, and with luck, we'll acquire such a business every couple of years. We'll wait patiently for market conditions to improve for equity purchases. We'll maintain our standards and our discipline. And we'll tell you the truth about what we're seeing and what we're doing, even when that truth isn't particularly exciting. That's the contract between management and owners, and it's one we take very seriously."

        "value": "The insurance industry is fundamentally a commodity business, and understanding why that's true tells you everything you need to know about why rational pricing discipline is impossible to maintain. When insurance leaders call for more \"statesmanlike\" behavior on pricing, they're really asking for something that violates basic economic laws. It's like asking water to flow uphill.\n\nLet me explain the mechanism. Insurance policies, particularly in standard lines, are essentially interchangeable products. One company's coverage looks pretty much like another's. When you're selling a commodity product, you have no pricing power except under conditions of shortage. Think about it: if there are ten companies willing to write the same policy, and nine of them are charging $1,000 while one charges $1,200, which company gets the business? The high-priced one gets nothing unless the others run out of capacity.\n\nNow here's where the cycle becomes inevitable and vicious. When shortage conditions do occur—maybe because previous price wars drove weak competitors out, or a series of catastrophes depleted capital—prices finally rise and profits improve. This is exactly what was happening in 1986 and 1987 when I wrote this. But the moment that profit sun begins to shine, rational economic actors respond in entirely predictable ways. Long-established insurers see an opportunity to earn attractive returns on new capital, so they rush to sell stock and build their capacity. Simultaneously, entrepreneurs see those same attractive returns and form new insurance companies, often taking advantage of a hot new-issue market where they can sell shares at premium prices.\n\nThe corn-growing analogy I used captures this perfectly. Imagine a Nebraska corn farmer standing up and saying, \"Fellow farmers worldwide, let's all agree to plant less corn so prices stay high.\" It's absurd on its face. Every individual farmer has an incentive to plant more when prices are good, and no individual farmer's restraint makes any difference to the overall market. The collective action problem is insurmountable.\n\nWhat these insurance leaders really want is pricing like The Wall Street Journal enjoys—starting from a position of strength and raising prices consistently each year. But the Journal has something insurance companies don't: a differentiated product with genuine pricing power, at least in its core markets. You can't easily substitute another publication for the Journal if you need its specific content and readership.\n\nThe insurance industry's problem is that when everyone responds rationally to good times by expanding capacity, they collectively guarantee future misery. Capacity soars, competition intensifies, and prices collapse. It's not that insurance executives are stupid or short-sighted. They're trapped in a prisoner's dilemma where individual rationality produces collective irrationality. The capital raised in those good years becomes the \"surplus crop\" that depresses prices for years to come. No amount of appeals to statesmanship can overcome these fundamental economics. What's needed isn't better behavior—it's less capacity. But the very structure of the industry makes limiting capacity impossible."

        "value": "Our willingness to swing dramatically in volume—from the slowest-growing large insurer to the fastest-growing, and back again—reflects one of the most important principles in business: rational capital allocation requires the discipline to say no most of the time and yes aggressively when conditions are right. This isn't about being erratic or indecisive. It's about understanding that in a commodity business, the only sustainable edge is the discipline to wait for your pitch.\n\nLet me walk you through what was happening. In the years immediately before 1985, we were shrinking. We weren't shrinking because we'd lost our appetite for insurance or because Mike Goldberg had stopped working hard. We were shrinking because prices in the industry were inadequate. When prices don't make sense, the rational response is to write less business, even if that means your company contracts. Most insurance companies can't or won't do this. They have large fixed costs, employees to keep busy, agency relationships to maintain, and Wall Street expectations about growth to meet. So they keep writing business at inadequate prices, essentially paying customers to take their money.\n\nWe don't have those constraints, and that's an enormous advantage. We don't come and go from the insurance marketplace—we're always there, always ready to write business. But we only write substantial volumes when we can do so at prices that make economic sense. When industry conditions turned in 1985 and 1986, with prices finally improving after years of destructive competition, we opened the throttle. Our combined ratio improved from 111 to 103, and our premium growth was exceptional. Some of that growth came from the Fireman's Fund quota-share contract, but even excluding that, we probably ranked first in growth among large insurers.\n\nThis approach requires several things that are harder than they sound. First, you need the financial strength to shrink without threatening your survival. Many insurers are trapped—they need premium volume to cover fixed costs and service debt. Second, you need patient shareholders who understand what you're doing and why. If your shareholders demand steady growth every quarter, you can't practice this kind of discipline. Third, you need managers like Mike Goldberg who understand that their job isn't to maximize volume but to maximize long-term profitability, even if that means having less to do in some years.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about the difference between activity and achievement. Most businesses confuse the two. They think that growing, staying busy, and maintaining market share are accomplishments in themselves. But in a commodity business with cyclical economics, the real accomplishment is making money over the full cycle. That requires the emotional fortitude to look lazy or timid during the boom times when everyone else is growing, and the operational capability to scale up quickly when conditions turn favorable.\n\nLooking ahead, I said we would shrink again from time to time in the future, and we have. The industry cycle I described was already turning—the good news in earnings was following the good news in prices by six to twelve months, but I expected the improving trend to end by late 1988 or early 1989. When that happened, when all that new capacity from capital raises started chasing business and prices deteriorated, we would pull back again. That's not a bug in our system; it's a feature. The companies that maintain steady growth through all conditions are the ones that will ultimately destroy value for their shareholders."

In fact, understanding the treacherous nature of insurance is precisely what gives us an advantage. Most insurance executives who get reserves wrong don't talk about it the way I'm talking about it. They use those euphemisms, they downplay the errors, and they don't internalize the lessons. We're doing the opposite. We're staring our mistakes right in the face.\n\nThe insurance business has what I call commodity economics in many of its segments.

We're not going to get complacent just because we have some good years, and we're not going to panic just because we've had trouble with reserves.\n\nWhat gives me confidence despite these reserve errors is that we have genuine, sustainable advantages. First, we have an advantage in attitude—we're willing to admit mistakes and learn from them rather than sweep them under the rug. Second, we have an advantage in capital, which means we can withstand the inevitable surprises that will come our way. Third, we're developing an advantage in personnel, attracting people who understand the business and share our cautious approach. And fourth, we have what I believe is a long-term edge in investing the float that comes from policyholder funds.\n\nThese advantages are real and they're durable. The reserve errors don't negate them; if anything, they remind us why we need every single one of these advantages to prosper in this business. Insurance isn't going to be a smooth ride with predictable results every year. Progress will be irregular. But over the long term, with our advantages and our wary attitude, we expect to both grow and make significant money.\n\nThe key is matching your expectations to reality. We're not promising perfection in reserving—clearly, we haven't achieved that. We're promising honesty about our mistakes, constant vigilance, and the deployment of real competitive advantages over time.

GEICO can offer lower prices than its competitors and still make better profits, or it can match competitors' prices and generate substantially higher returns. That's an enormous structural advantage.\n\nWhat's particularly impressive is that even the other large direct writers—companies like Allstate and State Farm that also sell directly to consumers without agents—have appreciably higher costs than GEICO. So this isn't just about the direct-writing model versus the agency model. GEICO has figured out how to operate more efficiently than virtually everyone else in the industry, regardless of their distribution method.\n\nThis cost advantage creates a virtuous cycle. Lower costs allow lower prices, which attract more customers, which spreads fixed costs over a larger base, which can lead to even lower unit costs. Meanwhile, competitors with higher cost structures are stuck. They can't easily replicate GEICO's efficiency because it's built into the company's culture, systems, and operations over many years. It's not one thing they do differently; it's hundreds of things done slightly better every day.\n\nNow, let's talk about what this teaches us about competitive advantage more broadly. The best competitive advantages are structural and durable. GEICO's cost advantage isn't based on having a patent that will expire or a charismatic CEO who might leave. It's embedded in the fundamental economics of how the business operates. That's the kind of moat we look for in businesses—something that's hard to replicate and that compounds over time.\n\nCompare GEICO's book of business to Berkshire's own insurance book, which I candidly admit is far inferior. We own 41% of GEICO, and our share of their premium volume is over $500 million, nearly double what it was just three years earlier. That growth, combined with profitability, is the hallmark of a truly superior business. And notice that GEICO was repurchasing its own shares, reducing the share count by 5.5% during the year. That's what you do when you have a great business generating more cash than you need for growth—you buy back stock and increase the ownership stake of remaining shareholders.\n\nThe lesson here extends beyond insurance. In any industry, the low-cost producer with a sustainable cost advantage has a tremendous competitive position. It's not glamorous—nobody writes magazine articles celebrating efficient claims processing or streamlined underwriting. But these operational advantages are far more valuable than flashy marketing campaigns or temporary product innovations. They're what separate truly great businesses from merely good ones, and they're what allow a company to prosper year after year, regardless of industry conditions."

The math here is actually quite simple, though its implications are profound. If American businesses in aggregate earn 12% on equity, then the owners of those businesses - the stockholders - must in aggregate earn less than 12%. They can't earn more. It's mathematically impossible.\n\nWhy must stockholders earn less? Because of the frictional costs of ownership. Every time stocks change hands, there are transaction costs - brokerage commissions, bid-ask spreads, market impact costs. Then you layer on top of that the investment management fees, the advisory fees, the custodial fees, and all the other costs associated with the investment industry. These costs are real, they come directly out of returns, and they're substantial. When you add up all these costs across the entire market, stockholders as a group are guaranteed to underperform the businesses they own.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. During bull markets, this mathematical law appears to be suspended. Stock prices can rise much faster than business values for extended periods. An investor might buy a business earning 12% on equity, and if the market decides to revalue that business upward - say, by expanding the price-to-earnings multiple - that investor might make 25% or 30% or even more in a single year. This is what I mean when I talk about rewards to owners becoming \"gloriously uncoupled\" from the actual performance of the businesses themselves.\n\nThis creates a dangerous illusion. Investors start to believe that stocks are somehow magic, that they can perpetually deliver returns far in excess of what the underlying businesses earn. They forget that they're not trading pieces of paper - they're buying fractional interests in actual businesses with real economics. The paper can get repriced, but eventually, the price must bear some relationship to the value being created by the business.\n\nBull markets can obscure this mathematical reality, sometimes for years, but they cannot repeal it. Gravity always reasserts itself. If stocks have outperformed businesses for a period, they must subsequently underperform businesses to bring things back into balance. The longer and more extreme the deviation, the more painful the correction tends to be.\n\nThis is why we focus on buying good businesses at sensible prices rather than trying to predict market movements. We can't control whether Mr. Market decides to get manic or depressive. But we can control what price we pay relative to business value. If we buy well below intrinsic value, we have a margin of safety. The business itself can bail us out through its earnings, even if the market stays irrational for a long time. But if we pay prices that assume perfection, we're entirely dependent on someone else being willing to pay an even sillier price later. That's not investing - that's speculation."

But implementing this approach is extraordinarily difficult, both psychologically and practically, which is why so few investors actually do it successfully.\n\nFirst, let's talk about why this approach makes sense. Markets are made up of people, and people are subject to emotional extremes. When fear takes hold, it spreads like a contagion. Everyone starts selling at once, often without regard to underlying business values. Prices can fall far below what a rational buyer would pay for the entire business in a private transaction. Conversely, when greed dominates, people start buying anything that's going up, paying prices that make no sense relative to the cash those businesses will generate over time. These emotional epidemics create opportunities for those who can remain rational.\n\nNow, here's the practical challenge: How do you actually know when others are fearful or greedy? It's not as obvious as it sounds. In the situation I'm describing in this letter, I can see that little fear is visible on Wall Street. Euphoria prevails. But I'm not making a market prediction based on that observation. I'm not saying the market will crash next month or next year. I'm simply saying we can't find equities that meet our tests - companies with good economics and good management selling well below intrinsic business value.\n\nThis is the key to implementation: We don't try to time the market or predict when fear or greed will arrive or depart. Instead, we maintain a consistent standard for what we're willing to pay. We know what a good business looks like, we know how to estimate intrinsic value, and we have a price discipline. When euphoria prevails, we find that most stocks are priced above our estimates of value, so we don't buy. We wait. When fear prevails, we find opportunities everywhere, so we buy aggressively.\n\nThe psychological difficulty cannot be overstated. When everyone around you is making money hand over fist in a bull market, and you're sitting on cash because you can't find anything cheap enough, you feel like an idiot. Your relatives ask why you're not participating. Other investors mock your caution. The pressure to join the party is immense. Similarly, when fear grips the market and prices are plummeting, buying feels terrifying. Every purchase seems to immediately go down further. The headlines are apocalyptic. Your stomach churns. Every instinct tells you to sell, not buy.\n\nThis is why most investors fail at contrarian investing despite understanding the principle intellectually. They can't stand the discomfort of being out of step with the crowd. They need the comfort of consensus. But consensus is the enemy of superior returns. If you're doing what everyone else is doing, you'll get the same results everyone else gets - which, remember, must be below the returns of the underlying businesses due to frictional costs.\n\nOur approach requires patience, discipline, and emotional stability. We must be willing to look foolish for extended periods. We must be able to sit with cash when we can't find opportunities, even if the market keeps going up without us. And we must have the courage to buy when the environment feels most frightening. It's not a comfortable way to invest, but it's the only way we know to achieve superior long-term results while maintaining a margin of safety."

When you find a wonderful business run by people you trust and admire, the intelligent thing to do is to stay with it, not to jump around based on short-term price fluctuations or the latest Wall Street fashion.\n\nLet me explain the reasoning here. When we buy into a business, whether it's 100% like See's Candies or a significant stake like we have in Capital Cities/ABC, GEICO, and The Washington Post, we're not buying a stock ticker symbol. We're becoming business owners. And as business owners, our job is to think about the long-term economic characteristics of the enterprise, not to play games with price movements. If you owned a wonderful private business that was earning good returns on capital and had excellent management, you wouldn't dream of selling it just because someone offered you a temporarily inflated price. You'd recognize that over the long term, the business itself would generate far more value for you than any one-time premium you might capture.\n\nThe modern corporate approach I describe in the letter has it backwards. Managers talk about their \"portfolio\" of businesses as if they're running a mutual fund rather than an operating company. They're constantly buying and selling based on whatever concept is fashionable on Wall Street at the moment. And notice the hypocrisy I point out: they're quick to dump businesses that don't work out, but they never dump themselves, even though they're the ones who made the bad acquisition decisions in the first place. \"Hate the sin but love the sinner\" indeed.\n\nThe investment management world is even worse. I use that phrase \"whirling dervishes\" because that's exactly what it looks like. These so-called institutional investors are trading constantly, churning their portfolios, generating fees and taxes, all while pretending they're engaged in something called \"investing.\" That's why I say the term \"institutional investor\" has become an oxymoron, like \"jumbo shrimp.\" Real investing means committing capital for the long term based on business fundamentals, not jumping in and out based on price movements or quarterly results.\n\nOur approach produces several concrete benefits. First, it lets the managers of our investee companies run their businesses without worrying that we're going to dump the stock at the first sign of trouble. They can make long-term decisions, invest in their businesses properly, and not worry about short-term earnings fluctuations. Second, it saves us from making foolish decisions. The stock market will periodically offer you chances to do stupid things. By committing to permanence, we protect ourselves from our own potential mistakes. Third, it minimizes taxes and frictional costs. Every time you sell a winner and buy something else, you're paying taxes and transaction costs that create a significant drag on returns.\n\nMost importantly, this approach is simply more comfortable for Charlie and me. We sleep well at night knowing we own pieces of wonderful businesses run by people we trust. We're not worried about what the market will do tomorrow or next month. That peace of mind, combined with superior long-term results, makes our \"old-fashioned\" approach the only one that makes sense to us."

In fact, in investing, excessive activity is almost always the enemy of long-term results, yet it's become the dominant behavior in modern financial markets.\n\nLet me walk through why this matters. When investment managers trade constantly, they're making an implicit claim: that they can predict short-term price movements better than the collective wisdom of all other market participants. Think about how audacious that claim really is. You're saying that you know something important that isn't already reflected in the current price, and you know it with enough certainty to overcome the significant costs of being wrong. The mathematics of this are brutal. Every time you sell one stock and buy another, you're incurring transaction costs and, if you're selling a winner, you're triggering taxes. These costs create a high hurdle that your new investment must clear just to break even.\n\nBut the costs go deeper than just fees and taxes. There's an enormous opportunity cost to this hyperactivity. When you're constantly churning your portfolio, you're necessarily selling your winners to buy new ideas. Over time, this means you're systematically cutting short your best investments while holding onto or replacing your mediocre ones. It's exactly backwards from what you should be doing, which is letting your winners run and run and run.\n\nI use that phrase about whirling dervishes quite deliberately. If you watch a trading floor or look at the turnover rates of most institutional portfolios, it's almost comical. Stocks are held for months or even weeks. The entire portfolio might turn over multiple times in a single year. This isn't investing; it's speculation dressed up in institutional clothing. And the term \"institutional investor\" really has become an oxymoron, right up there with \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"inexpensive lawyer.\" These institutions have the resources, the talent, and the time horizon to be real investors, but instead they've chosen to become traders.\n\nNow, why does this happen? Several reasons. First, there's career risk for professional managers. If you sit still and do nothing while other managers are active, you risk looking lazy or disengaged, even if doing nothing is the intelligent choice. Second, activity generates fees. Brokers, consultants, and active managers all benefit from turnover. Third, there's a psychological element. Doing something feels productive. Sitting quietly and letting your businesses compound in value feels passive, even though it's often the smartest strategy.\n\nThe contrast with our approach couldn't be starker. When we buy Capital Cities/ABC, GEICO, or The Washington Post, we're not thinking about what the stock price will do next quarter or next year. We're thinking about what the business will look like in ten or twenty years. We're evaluating the economic characteristics of the enterprise, the quality of management, and the price we're paying relative to long-term value. Then we sit still and let the business do its work.\n\nThis patience produces tangible results. Our investee companies can manage for the long term without worrying about quarterly earnings fluctuations. We avoid the taxes and frictional costs of constant trading. Most importantly, we get to compound our capital at the rate these wonderful businesses generate returns, without interruption. That's the real secret: find great businesses, pay reasonable prices, and then get out of the way. The hyperkinetic approach might generate a lot of activity and fees, but it rarely generates superior long-term returns for the actual investors."

A lot of people got excited about the corporate rate dropping from 46% to 34%, and sure, that's good news at first glance. But you can't stop your analysis there.\n\nLet me walk you through the math, because it illustrates a fundamental principle about investment returns. When we build value inside Berkshire, we're hoping that value eventually gets reflected in the stock price. Under the old tax regime, if we created a dollar of per-share value and the stock price went up by a dollar to reflect that, our shareholders could sell and keep 80 cents after paying the 20% capital gains tax. Under the new law, they keep only 72 cents because the capital gains rate went to 28%. That's a 10% haircut on the after-tax value our shareholders receive from our efforts.\n\nNow, you might say, \"But Warren, you're getting that lower corporate rate, so you'll create more value in the first place.\" And that's partially true. The lower corporate rate does help us compound capital faster inside Berkshire. But here's the thing: we have to create significantly more value just to get our shareholders back to where they were before. It's like running up a down escalator that just got faster.\n\nThis gets to a broader point about investment analysis that I think is crucial. You always have to look at returns on an after-tax basis from the perspective of the ultimate owner. Too many people focus on pre-tax returns or corporate-level metrics and forget that there's another layer of taxation waiting at the shareholder level. The money isn't really yours until you can spend it, and you can't spend it until you've paid the tax man.\n\nWhat makes this particularly frustrating is that we're very tax-efficient at Berkshire. We don't pay dividends, so our shareholders don't face annual taxation on their holdings. They only pay tax when they sell, which gives them control over the timing. But even with that advantage, the increase in the capital gains rate is a real economic cost. It's a permanent reduction in the after-tax compounding rate our shareholders can achieve.\n\nThe lesson here is that tax policy matters enormously to long-term investment returns. An eight percentage point increase in the capital gains rate might not sound dramatic, but compound it over decades and it makes a huge difference in terminal wealth. When politicians talk about tax changes, investors need to think carefully about the full impact, not just the headline numbers. You need to trace the dollar all the way through from the business earning it to the shareholder spending it, accounting for every tax along the way. That's the only way to understand what's really happening to your returns."

        "value": "This is one of those questions where fuzzy thinking has dominated the debate for years, and it's worth getting clear on the economics because it tells you a lot about the fundamental nature of different businesses. The answer isn't ideological; it's analytical, and it depends entirely on the specific characteristics of each business.\n\nLet me start with the principle. When corporate taxes go down, that money has to go somewhere. Either it stays with the corporation and its shareholders as increased profits, or it flows through to customers as lower prices. The people who argue it always goes one way or the other are both wrong. The reality depends on two key factors: the strength of the business franchise and whether returns are regulated.\n\nThink about a regulated electric utility first, because it's the clearest case. These companies are essentially guaranteed a certain return on equity by their regulators. If the utility is allowed to earn, say, 12% on equity, and corporate taxes get cut, the regulators will fairly quickly adjust prices downward so the utility still earns just that 12%. The tax savings flow right through to customers in the form of lower electric rates. The utility and its shareholders don't benefit much at all. That's the pipeline theory in action, and it's correct for this type of business.\n\nNow contrast that with a company that has a strong, unregulated franchise. Take The Washington Post Company, which we owned a large stake in. The Post had a dominant position in its market. When its corporate tax rate dropped, did it lower its advertising rates proportionally? Of course not. The value of reaching Post readers didn't change just because the tax code changed. Advertisers were willing to pay the same rates as before because the franchise value was unchanged. So the tax savings went straight to the bottom line and benefited the Post and its shareholders.\n\nThis distinction reveals something profound about business quality. A truly strong franchise has pricing power that's independent of its cost structure. The price is set by the value delivered to customers, not by costs plus some markup. When costs go down, whether from tax cuts or operational improvements, the benefits accrue to the owner of the franchise. Conversely, a weak franchise or a regulated one has to pass along cost changes because it lacks the power to do otherwise.\n\nThis framework is incredibly useful for investors. When you're analyzing a business, ask yourself: if this company's costs dropped by 10%, could it keep prices the same? If the answer is yes, you're looking at a strong franchise. If the answer is no, if competition or regulation would force price cuts, then you're looking at a weaker economic model. The companies where cost savings flow to the bottom line are the ones you want to own.\n\nThe practical implication is that tax cuts are much more valuable to shareholders of strong-franchise businesses than to shareholders of weak-franchise or regulated businesses. When you hear politicians debating corporate tax policy, you need to think about which companies will actually benefit. It's not uniform across the economy. Some businesses will see real profit improvement, while others will simply pass the savings along. Understanding this distinction is essential to being a thoughtful investor and to understanding how capitalism actually works in practice."

        "value": "The answer comes down to pricing power, and it's one of the most important concepts in understanding business economics. When a company has a strong franchise, tax cuts flow through to shareholders. When it doesn't, those tax savings get competed away and end up benefiting customers instead.\n\nLet me walk you through the three different scenarios, because understanding these distinctions is crucial. First, take regulated utilities. When an electric company gets a tax cut, it doesn't get to keep that money. The Public Utilities Commission steps in and says, \"Your profits are regulated, so if your costs went down due to lower taxes, your prices need to come down too.\" The savings get passed to customers pretty quickly. When taxes go up, the reverse happens - prices rise to maintain the regulated profit level, though sometimes there's a lag.\n\nSecond, consider highly competitive industries where companies have weak franchises. Here there's no formal regulator, but the free market acts like one. If you're in a commodity business where you're competing intensely on price - think of a company making basic products where customers see no difference between suppliers - you can't raise prices when you want to. Your after-tax returns get regulated by competition itself. It's slower and messier than a utilities commission, but it works the same way over time. Tax cuts in these industries eventually lead to price competition that transfers the benefit to customers.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting - the third category. When you have an unregulated business with a strong franchise, everything changes. These companies have pricing power. They're not forced by regulators to cut prices, and they're not forced by competition to cut prices either. So when their taxes go down, they just keep the money. It flows straight through to the bottom line and stays there.\n\nThink about the brain surgeon or lawyer I mentioned - the best one in your town. That person has a franchise in their specialty. When the top tax rate dropped from 50% to 28%, did that surgeon cut his fees? Of course not. He kept charging what the market would bear based on his skill and reputation. The tax savings went right into his pocket.\n\nThe same principle applies to our businesses at Berkshire. Many of them have strong franchises - they have something special that gives them pricing power. Maybe it's a brand, maybe it's a unique market position, maybe it's a cost advantage that's hard to replicate. Whatever the source, when these businesses get a tax cut, we're the beneficiaries, not our customers.\n\nNow, I know this sounds impolitic to say so bluntly. But it's simply the truth, and investors need to understand it. The quality of a business franchise determines who captures economic benefits - whether from tax changes, cost reductions, or other improvements in the business environment. Strong franchises mean shareholders win. Weak franchises or regulation mean customers win. This is why we're always looking for businesses with durable competitive advantages. They're the ones where good things that happen - like tax cuts - actually stick to the bottom line instead of getting competed away."

The government had made promises - through Social Security, Medicare, defense commitments, and everything else - that couldn't be funded at those low rates without creating serious fiscal problems. Something had to give, and we figured within five years we'd see either higher tax rates, higher inflation, or quite possibly both.\n\nHere's the logic. When a government cuts taxes substantially without cutting spending to match, it creates a deficit. That deficit has to be financed somehow. There are really only a few ways to handle it. You can borrow the money, but that just pushes the problem into the future and eventually you need higher taxes to service the debt. You can print money to cover the gap, but that leads to inflation. Or you can actually raise taxes back up. We figured one way or another, the bill would come due.\n\nThis matters enormously for investors because different types of businesses handle tax increases and inflation very differently. Let me explain using our own portfolio as an example. We held major positions in Cap Cities, GEICO, and Washington Post - over $1.7 billion in market value, representing about 75% of Berkshire's net worth at the time. These companies paid us only about $9 million in annual dividends. Instead, they retained most of their earnings to reinvest in their businesses.\n\nOur returns from these investments were going to come primarily through capital gains, not dividends. We'd buy at one price, the companies would retain and reinvest their earnings wisely, the business values would grow, and eventually we'd realize gains when we sold or the market recognized the increased value. That's a wonderful way to build wealth when it works.\n\nBut here's the problem: the new tax law raised the capital gains rate from 28% to 34%. That's a significant haircut on our future returns. And it applied not just to future gains, but retroactively to all the unrealized gains we already had on our books. We'd bought these stocks years earlier at much lower prices. The gain that had already built up - the difference between what we paid and what they were worth - was now going to be taxed at the higher rate when we eventually sold.\n\nThink about what this means in practical terms. If a business doubles in value and you have a 28% tax rate, you keep 72% of the gain after taxes. At 34%, you keep only 66%. That six-percentage-point difference might not sound like much, but compound it over decades and it's enormous. It directly reduces the after-tax compounding rate of your capital.\n\nNow, inflation creates a different but equally serious problem. When you have inflation, nominal values go up but real values might not. You might sell a stock for twice what you paid, but if inflation cut the dollar's purchasing power in half, you haven't really gained anything in real terms. Yet you still pay capital gains tax on the nominal gain. You're paying real taxes on phantom gains. It's a terrible deal for investors.\n\nThis is why we pay such close attention to tax and monetary policy. These aren't abstract political issues - they directly affect the real returns our shareholders earn. A business that generates its returns through capital gains is particularly vulnerable to changes in capital gains tax rates. And all investors are vulnerable to inflation, which acts as a hidden tax on top of the explicit ones. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone trying to compound capital over long periods."

The key insight is that price competition only produces uniform outcomes when all the major players face similar cost structures.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. In most price-competitive industries—think aluminum, automobiles, or department stores—when costs change for the industry, they change uniformly. If taxes go up for General Motors, they go up similarly for Ford and Chrysler. Everyone's in the same boat, so the industry can collectively adjust prices upward, and customers have nowhere else to turn. The competitive equilibrium shifts, but it shifts for everyone together.\n\nBut property/casualty insurance in 1987 is facing something quite different. The new tax law created wildly disparate tax situations across different insurers. Some companies are hit hard by the new alternative minimum tax while others aren't affected at all. Certain major insurers are sitting on huge loss carry-forwards that will shelter their income from taxes for years to come—they're essentially operating in a low-tax or no-tax environment. Still others are part of consolidated returns with non-insurance businesses, creating yet another tax equation entirely.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting from a competitive standpoint. Imagine you're an insurer with big loss carry-forwards. Your marginal tax rate is essentially zero for the next few years. You can price your policies more aggressively than a competitor who's paying full freight on taxes. You're not being irrational or predatory—you're simply reflecting your actual cost structure. Meanwhile, companies like Berkshire that are paying the full new tax rates can't raise prices to compensate because we'd lose business to these lower-taxed competitors.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from, say, the aluminum industry where Reynolds, Alcoa, and Kaiser all face essentially the same tax burden. When their taxes go up, the industry can move prices up together because no major player has a structural tax advantage that would let them undercut the others profitably.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about truly understanding your competitive position. It's not enough to know you're in a price-competitive industry. You need to understand whether cost changes affect all competitors equally. When they don't—when there's structural variation in cost positions—the competitive dynamics become much more complex and often much less favorable for the high-cost producers.\n\nFor Berkshire's insurance operations, this meant we were going to eat most of the tax increase. We couldn't pass it through to customers because our competitors with different tax situations would be happy to take our business at lower prices that still worked for their economics. This is the kind of granular industry analysis that matters. The superficial view—\"insurance is price-competitive, so tax changes get passed through\"—misses the critical detail that makes all the difference to actual profitability."

The distinction between one-time benefits and permanent changes in business economics is absolutely crucial to valuing any enterprise, and this situation illustrates why.\n\nLet me explain what's actually happening with this fresh start adjustment. Under the new tax law, we're required to discount our loss reserves for tax purposes starting January 1, 1987. The mechanics of switching from the old system to the new one create what amounts to a double deduction. We get to deduct in 1987 and future years a portion of insurance losses that we already fully deducted as costs in 1986 and earlier years. It's found money, in a sense—a quirk of the transition rules that puts some extra cash in our pocket.\n\nNow, thirty to forty million dollars is real money, and we'll certainly take it. But here's what concerns me about how people might think about this: there's a natural human tendency to focus on the concrete, immediate gain and downplay the abstract, ongoing cost. The fresh start benefit will show up in our earnings over the next few years as reduced tax charges. It's visible and measurable. Meanwhile, the negative impacts of the other tax changes are ongoing and, in important ways, will actually get worse over time.\n\nThink about the difference in present value terms. A one-time forty-million-dollar benefit might be worth, say, forty million dollars. But an ongoing annual cost increase—even if it's smaller in any single year—compounds into something far more significant when you're valuing a business that we expect to own forever. If the new tax structure costs us even five million dollars annually in perpetuity, that's worth vastly more than the one-time benefit at any reasonable discount rate.\n\nThis gets to a fundamental principle of business analysis: you must distinguish between the temporary and the permanent. Corporate managers love to tout one-time gains—asset sales, tax benefits, litigation settlements—because they boost reported earnings. But these don't change the underlying earning power of the enterprise. Conversely, permanent changes in the cost structure or competitive position, even if they're gradual or hard to quantify precisely, are what really determine value.\n\nIn our insurance operations, the fresh start adjustment is going to make our reported earnings look better for a few years than the underlying economics would suggest. A casual observer might think, \"Well, the tax changes weren't so bad—look at these results.\" But that would be exactly the wrong conclusion. The true economic picture is that our insurance businesses face permanently higher tax burdens that will drag on returns for decades to come.\n\nI'm explaining this in detail because I want our shareholders to think like business owners, not like people watching quarterly earnings reports. When you own a business—really own it for the long term, as we do—you need to see through accounting presentations to economic reality. The fresh start benefit is nice, but it doesn't change the fact that the 1986 tax law made our insurance operations permanently less valuable. The benefit is a one-time rebate on a permanent price increase, and the price increase is much larger than the rebate.\n\nThis kind of clear-eyed analysis is essential. In business and investing, you'll constantly encounter situations where short-term factors obscure long-term realities. Your job is to separate the signal from the noise, the permanent from the temporary, and make decisions based on what truly matters to long-term value creation."

        "value": "The fundamental issue here is distinguishing between accounting artifacts and economic reality. When we bought Scott Fetzer, the accounting rules forced us to create $11.6 million in annual charges that the previous owners never had to record. But here's the critical point: nothing about the actual business changed. The factories didn't become less efficient, the products didn't become less valuable, and the cash flows didn't diminish. Yet GAAP earnings dropped from $40.2 million to $28.6 million simply because of how the purchase was structured on paper.\n\nThis gets to the heart of why I prefer to be \"vaguely right than precisely wrong,\" as Keynes said. GAAP gives you precise numbers down to the penny, but precision isn't the same as accuracy when it comes to understanding what a business is really worth. Those accounting charges weren't costing us actual cash that we had to spend each year. They were just bookkeeping entries required by the rules. The real question for any owner is: what cash can this business generate that I can either reinvest or take out?\n\nThat's why we developed the owner earnings formula. Start with reported earnings, add back depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges, then subtract the capital expenditures the business truly needs to maintain its competitive position and unit volume. That last part requires judgment, which makes some people uncomfortable. They'd rather have a false precision than make an estimate. But if you're going to be a business owner or investor, you need to think about what the business actually requires to stay healthy.\n\nLet me illustrate why this matters so much. If you were considering buying Scott Fetzer and only looked at GAAP earnings, you might think the business became 29% less valuable the day after we bought it compared to the day before. That's absurd. The economic engine was identical. The same management was running the same operations serving the same customers. The only thing that changed was the accounting treatment.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something important: not all non-cash charges should be added back. Depreciation often understates the true cost of maintaining a business, especially in capital-intensive industries. That's why step (c) in our formula is so crucial. You have to honestly assess what the business needs to spend to stay competitive. If a railroad needs to spend more on track maintenance than its depreciation charge, then owner earnings are actually lower than GAAP earnings.\n\nThe broader lesson is this: accounting is a language for describing business reality, but it's an imperfect language with arbitrary rules. As an investor or manager, your job is to see through the accounting to the underlying economics. Focus on the cash that a business generates and requires. That's what determines value, not the accounting conventions that some rule-making body has decided upon. When Company O and Company N are economically identical but show different GAAP earnings, owner earnings helps you see that they're worth exactly the same amount, which is what common sense tells you should be true."

        "value": "This is one of those situations where the accounting rules and the tax rules diverge completely, and understanding that divergence is absolutely critical to understanding what you're really getting when you buy a business. The IRS doesn't care about our $11.6 million in additional GAAP charges. We can't use them to reduce our tax bill. So while our reported earnings went down, our actual cash taxes stayed exactly the same as they would have been if the previous owners had continued running the company.\n\nThink about what this means in practical terms. Every year, Scott Fetzer generates a certain amount of pre-tax income from its operations. The tax collector takes his share based on that operating income, regardless of how we had to account for the purchase. The government isn't giving us a discount because of accounting conventions. This tells you something profound: those accounting charges aren't real economic costs in the way that, say, paying workers or buying raw materials are real costs.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting and where careful thinking really pays off. I mentioned that if Scott Fetzer were to sell one of its businesses, the tax consequences for the \"old\" and \"new\" company might differ widely. This is because the stepped-up basis we created when we bought the company could affect capital gains calculations. But notice I said this scenario is \"unlikely.\" We're not in the business of buying companies to break them up and sell the pieces. We're buying businesses to own and operate them for the long term.\n\nThis distinction between operating economics and potential sale economics is crucial for how we think about acquisitions. Some buyers might pay up for a business because they can create tax benefits through financial engineering or by planning to sell off parts. That's not our game. We're focused on the cash that the business will generate from its operations over many years, and we're focused on what taxes we'll actually pay on that cash.\n\nThe tax situation also reveals something about the nature of goodwill and purchase accounting. When we paid $142.6 million more than book value for Scott Fetzer, we were paying for intangible assets, customer relationships, brand value, and superior economics that weren't captured on the old balance sheet. The accounting rules make us write down that premium over time through various charges, but the IRS recognizes that we actually paid that premium with real after-tax dollars. We can't get a tax deduction for paying up for quality.\n\nThis is why I'm always emphasizing the importance of looking at after-tax returns and actual cash flows. You can have two companies with identical GAAP earnings but very different tax situations, and therefore very different values to their owners. The cash you can put in your pocket after the tax collector has taken his share is what matters, not the earnings figure that gets reported in the press.\n\nFor any investor or manager evaluating an acquisition, here's the key lesson: understand what you're actually going to pay in taxes based on the real operations of the business, not based on accounting charges. Those accounting charges will affect your reported earnings and your reported return on equity, which might matter if you care a lot about how things look on paper. But they don't affect the actual cash economics of owning the business, which is what should matter if you're thinking like an owner rather than thinking like someone who's just trying to manage quarterly earnings reports."

        "value": "The \"cash flow\" numbers you see in Wall Street reports are misleading because they're incomplete – and dangerously so. These presentations typically show you earnings plus depreciation and amortization, which sounds comprehensive, but they conveniently leave out the capital expenditures necessary to maintain the business's competitive position. It's like showing you all the money coming into your household while ignoring that your roof needs replacing every twenty years and your car will eventually wear out.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When we talk about the true economic earnings of a business – what Charlie and I call \"owner earnings\" – we need to look at three components: reported earnings (a), plus depreciation and amortization (b), minus the capital expenditures needed to maintain the business's economic position and unit volume (c). The Wall Street version stops after adding (a) and (b), completely ignoring (c). This creates a fantasy world where businesses never need to reinvest to stay competitive.\n\nThe absurdity becomes clear when you think about it practically. If you took all the sales brochures from investment bankers seriously – where they present these incomplete cash flow figures – you'd have to believe that American businesses are like the Pyramids,永 state-of-the-art and never needing replacement or improvement. If that were true, our national spending on plant and equipment could be cut by ninety percent! Obviously, that's nonsense.\n\nNow, I'll grant you that \"cash flow\" can be useful shorthand in very specific situations. If you own a bridge or an extremely long-lived gas field – assets that require huge upfront investment but minimal ongoing capital expenditure – then sure, cash flow tells you something meaningful. The cash really does flow to the owners without significant reinvestment needs. But for manufacturing companies, retailers, extractive businesses, and utilities, this approach is worse than useless because it's actively deceptive.\n\nThe oil industry provides a perfect example of this phenomenon. In recent years, if major oil companies had spent only their depreciation charges on capital expenditures, they would have guaranteed their own decline. They needed to spend substantially more than depreciation just to maintain their competitive position and reserve base. So their GAAP earnings actually overstated their true owner earnings, sometimes substantially.\n\nWhy do these misleading figures persist? I'm afraid the answer reveals my cynicism about Wall Street practices. These numbers are popular because they help marketers sell businesses and securities that might otherwise be unsalable. By inflating the apparent cash generation of a business, they can justify prices that make no economic sense. It's a way to make the unjustifiable seem justified.\n\nWhat should you focus on instead? Look at the complete picture. Ask yourself: how much does this business really need to spend, over a five or ten-year period, to maintain its position? Some years they might defer spending, but over time, the investment must be made or the business decays. That's the reality, and that's what determines the true value available to owners."

        "value": "The Scott Fetzer situation is indeed happy, but it's also unusual, and understanding why gets to the heart of what separates great businesses from mediocre ones. In Scott Fetzer's case, the actual capital expenditures needed to maintain the business's competitive position are very close to the \"old\" company's depreciation figure of $8.3 million – much lower than the \"new\" company's depreciation of $19.9 million that includes amortization of acquisition goodwill. This means the reported GAAP earnings actually understate the true economic earnings available to us as owners.\n\nBut here's the critical point: this happy circumstance is the exception, not the rule. For most businesses, the reality runs in the opposite direction, and that tells you something profound about business quality. Most managers, if they're being honest, will acknowledge that they need to spend more than their depreciation charges just to stay in place – to maintain both their unit volume and competitive position. When that's true, when the required capital expenditures exceed depreciation, GAAP earnings overstate owner earnings, sometimes substantially.\n\nThink about what this means for business quality. A truly exceptional business is one that can maintain or even improve its competitive position without needing to spend more than its depreciation charges. These businesses have durable competitive advantages – what we call moats – that don't require constant, expensive reinforcement. They're not in an arms race with competitors where everyone must spend heavily just to avoid falling behind.\n\nContrast this with businesses in highly competitive or rapidly changing industries. A technology company might face obsolescence every few years, requiring massive reinvestment just to offer products that customers will still buy. A retailer might need to constantly remodel stores to match competitors' formats. A manufacturer might need to upgrade equipment continuously as rivals adopt more efficient processes. In all these cases, the depreciation charges on the books – which reflect historical costs spread over arbitrary accounting lives – bear little relationship to the actual cash that must be plowed back into the business.\n\nThe oil industry example I mentioned illustrates this perfectly. Oil companies must continually invest in exploration and development just to replace depleting reserves. Their depreciation charges, based on past investments, don't capture the current cost of maintaining their reserve base and production levels. So their reported earnings paint a rosier picture than economic reality justifies.\n\nThis is why Charlie and I spend so much time thinking about the economic characteristics of businesses, not just their reported numbers. We want businesses where the required reinvestment is low relative to earnings – where depreciation is a reasonably accurate proxy for true economic costs, or better yet, where it overstates those costs as with Scott Fetzer. These businesses generate cash that can actually be distributed to owners or redeployed elsewhere, rather than being trapped in a cycle of necessary reinvestment.\n\nWhen you find a business where owner earnings significantly exceed reported earnings, you've found something special. It means the business has characteristics that allow it to maintain its position without the heavy ongoing investment that most businesses require. That's a sign of a strong franchise, rational competition, or some other structural advantage. Conversely, when owner earnings fall well short of reported earnings – which is the more common situation – you need to adjust your valuation accordingly and recognize that the business quality is lower than the accounting numbers might suggest."

When someone talks about cash flow without discussing capital expenditures, they're giving you an incomplete and dangerously misleading picture of a business's true earning power.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. We have three key components: (a) is reported GAAP earnings, (b) is depreciation and amortization, and (c) is the capital expenditures needed to maintain the business's competitive position. Now, when a business isn't performing well enough to justify its debt load or stock price based on actual earnings, promoters love to add back depreciation to those earnings and call it \"cash flow.\" They're essentially saying, \"Look at all this cash the business generates!\" But here's the critical flaw in that thinking: depreciation isn't some accounting fiction that you can simply ignore.\n\nDepreciation represents the very real fact that the equipment, buildings, and other assets a business uses to generate earnings are wearing out. They're being consumed in the process of doing business. The dentist analogy I used captures this perfectly - just because you ignore your teeth doesn't mean they won't decay and eventually fall out. The same is true for a company's assets. If you don't replace them, your business will deteriorate and eventually fail.\n\nSo when you add back (b) - depreciation - you absolutely must subtract (c) - the capital expenditures needed to maintain your competitive position. These expenditures are every bit as real and necessary as the cost of labor or raw materials. At See's Candies, for instance, we spend $500,000 to $1 million more than our depreciation charge each year just to stay competitive. That's not growth capital; that's maintenance capital. If we didn't spend it, See's would gradually lose its competitive position.\n\nThe reason this matters so much is that many businesses, particularly those saddled with junk bond debt or trading at inflated prices, simply can't afford the truth. Their actual earnings don't support their capital structure or valuation. So the promoters resort to showing \"cash flow\" numbers that conveniently ignore the reality of required capital spending. It's financial sleight of hand.\n\nFor Berkshire's businesses, we've found that depreciation on a historical cost basis generally approximates the capital expenditures needed to maintain competitive position. That's why we feel comfortable looking at our operating earnings before amortization of intangibles as a reasonable proxy for owner earnings - the actual cash that could be distributed to owners while maintaining the business's competitive position.\n\nThe lesson for investors is straightforward: never evaluate a business based on cash flow numbers unless you've carefully examined what capital expenditures are required to maintain that business. Any promoter who emphasizes cash flow while downplaying or ignoring capital requirements is either fooling themselves or trying to fool you. In either case, you should run the other direction."

        "value": "This is one of the most important distinctions in business analysis, and it's something Charlie and I think about constantly. Accounting numbers are absolutely essential - they're the starting point for any serious evaluation of a business. But they're the beginning of the analysis, not the end of it. The accountant's job is to record what happened according to a set of rules; the investor's job is to figure out what it means.\n\nLet me explain why this distinction matters so much. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles exist to create consistency and comparability across companies. They're a set of rules that everyone agrees to follow so that financial statements mean roughly the same thing whether you're looking at a steel company or a software company. The accountants apply these rules faithfully, and that's exactly what they should do. They're the scorekeepers, not the referees or the coaches.\n\nBut here's the thing: GAAP rules can't possibly capture the economic reality of every business situation. They're designed for consistency, not for perfect accuracy in every circumstance. Take the amortization of intangibles that we discuss in the excerpt. When we buy a business and allocate part of the purchase price to intangible assets, GAAP requires us to amortize those intangibles over time, creating a charge against earnings. But does that charge represent real economic cost? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It depends entirely on the specific business and asset in question.\n\nAt Scott Fetzer and our other businesses, we've concluded that the amortization of acquisition intangibles doesn't represent real economic cost in the way that, say, the depreciation of a delivery truck does. The truck wears out and needs replacing; the economic value of a strong brand or customer relationships doesn't necessarily deteriorate in the same way. So while we dutifully record the amortization charge as GAAP requires, we don't view it as representing true economic cost when we're evaluating the business's earning power.\n\nThis is where business thinking comes in. You have to understand what the numbers represent and whether they accurately reflect economic reality for the specific situation you're analyzing. At See's, for example, the accounting shows depreciation of X dollars, but we know from experience that we need to spend X plus $500,000 to $1 million in capital expenditures just to maintain our competitive position. The accounting number is useful and important, but it doesn't tell the complete story.\n\nThe broader principle here is that investors and managers must think independently about what creates and destroys value in a business. Accounting provides crucial information, but it can't do your thinking for you. You need to ask questions like: What are the true economics of this business? What capital will it require over time? How durable are its competitive advantages? What are the real returns on invested capital? These questions require judgment, industry knowledge, and clear thinking - things that no accounting rule can provide.\n\nThe practical application is this: always start with the accounting numbers, because they're grounded in actual transactions and provide a disciplined framework. But then ask yourself whether those numbers accurately reflect the economic reality of the business. Where they don't, make adjustments based on your understanding of how the business actually works. This is what we mean by using accounting as an aid to thinking rather than a substitute for it. The numbers inform your judgment; they don't replace it."
