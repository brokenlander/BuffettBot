        "value": "That distinction is absolutely fundamental to everything we do at Berkshire, and I'm glad you asked because many people miss this point entirely. When we buy a stock, we're not thinking about whether it'll be higher next week or next month. We're asking ourselves: \"Do we want to own this business for the next decade or longer?\"\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. A stock picker is someone who's constantly looking at price movements, trading patterns, what analysts are saying, trying to guess what other investors will do. They're playing a game of anticipating market psychology. A business picker, on the other hand, is evaluating the underlying enterprise. We're asking: What does this company sell? Do customers love it? Will they love it ten years from now? Does it have pricing power? Can it grow without requiring massive capital investment? Who's running it, and can we trust them?\n\nWhen Charlie and I look at a publicly-traded stock, we use exactly the same mental framework we'd use if we were buying the entire company outright. If someone offered to sell us 100% of a business for a certain price, we'd evaluate its competitive position, its economics, its management, and its future prospects. We'd think about what it could earn over time and whether that justified the price. Well, when we buy shares in the stock market, we're doing precisely the same analysis. The only difference is we're buying a piece rather than the whole thing.\n\nThis approach changes everything about how you invest. If you're a stock picker, you might buy something you don't really understand because you think it's going up. You might sell a wonderful business because you're worried about a temporary price decline. You're essentially speculating on the behavior of other speculators. But if you're a business picker, you can ignore all that noise. When we bought Coca-Cola starting in 1988, we weren't thinking about where the stock would be in 1989. We were thinking about whether people would still be drinking Coke in 2000, 2010, 2020. We were thinking about the power of that brand, the distribution system, the economics of the concentrate business.\n\nThis distinction also explains why we can be so patient. If you own a piece of a wonderful business bought at a sensible price, you don't need to do anything. The business itself does the work for you. Management shows up every day trying to build value. Customers keep buying the products. The earnings compound. But if you're a stock picker, you feel like you need to constantly do something, make moves, respond to news. That's exhausting and, more importantly, it's counterproductive.\n\nThe beautiful thing about being business pickers is that it allows us to take advantage of what I mentioned in the text about market prices being foolish. When the market offers us a piece of a great business at a silly price, we can recognize that opportunity because we understand the business itself. We're not confused by the price action. We see through to the underlying value. That's the real secret, and it's available to anyone willing to think like a business owner rather than a stock trader."

        "value": "You mention that in 58 years, most of your capital-allocation decisions have been \"no better than so-so,\" yet Berkshire has achieved extraordinary results. How do you reconcile this seemingly modest self-assessment with your success, and what does this tell us about investing?"

        "value": "I think this is one of the most important lessons I can share, and it's actually quite liberating when you understand it. You don't need to be right very often to achieve outstanding results. You just need to be really right on a few big decisions and avoid making terrible mistakes that wipe you out.\n\nLet me break down the arithmetic for you. I said our satisfactory results came from about a dozen truly good decisions over 58 years. That's roughly one good decision every five years. Think about that. We're not talking about being brilliant every quarter or even every year. We're talking about occasionally recognizing a truly outstanding opportunity and then having the courage and resources to act on it in a big way. The rest of the time, we're making decisions that are adequate, mediocre, or sometimes poor. But here's the key: those so-so decisions didn't kill us, and the great decisions more than compensated for everything else.\n\nThis works because of how compounding functions over long periods. When you make a truly good decision, buying a wonderful business at a fair or better price, and then you hold it for decades, the results can be extraordinary. Look at our Coca-Cola investment that I mentioned. We spent seven years accumulating that position, finishing in 1994. That one decision has generated tens of billions of dollars in value for Berkshire. One decision. And we've just sat there, doing nothing, while that business has compounded for us.\n\nNow, contrast that with the alternative approach many investors take. They're trying to make good decisions constantly, trading in and out, always looking for the next thing. Even if they're right 60% of the time, which would be excellent, they're paying taxes on gains, paying trading costs, and most importantly, they're interrupting the compounding process. They're pulling up the flowers and watering the weeds, as Charlie likes to say.\n\nI also mentioned in the text that we've had some bad moves rescued by luck. USAir and Salomon were near-disasters. I made poor decisions there, but we survived them. This points to another crucial principle: don't bet the ranch on any single decision. We've always maintained a fortress balance sheet at Berkshire. We've never been in a position where one mistake could cripple us. This is what I mean about avoiding terrible mistakes. It's not about avoiding all mistakes, it's about avoiding the catastrophic ones.\n\nThe structure of our business also helps. With controlled businesses, we're not subject to the daily pricing of the stock market. We can't panic and sell at foolish prices because there's no market price tempting us. With our stock investments, we've trained ourselves to think like owners of private businesses, which means we don't get shaken out by volatility.\n\nThere's also an element of intellectual honesty here that I think is important. Many investors, especially professional money managers, feel pressure to claim they're making brilliant decisions all the time. They can't admit that most of their moves are mediocre because they're being judged constantly. But that pressure leads to overactivity and overconfidence. By acknowledging that most of my decisions have been so-so, I'm freed from the need to do something brilliant every day. I can wait for the fat pitch, as Ted Williams would say.\n\nThe practical lesson for investors is this: focus your energy on avoiding big mistakes and recognizing the rare, truly great opportunities. Don't worry about being right all the time. Build a portfolio and a life that can withstand being wrong frequently. And when you find something truly wonderful, be prepared to act decisively."

        "value": "This is one of the most important concepts in investing, and I'm glad you asked because most investors don't fully appreciate how the mathematics work in their favor when they get a few decisions really right. The principle is beautifully simple: your winners grow to dominate your portfolio while your mistakes become irrelevant, assuming you don't do anything foolish like selling your winners to chase new ideas.\n\nLet me walk you through the arithmetic using our actual experience. In the mid-1990s, we invested $1.3 billion each in Coca-Cola and American Express. These were meaningful investments – significant portions of Berkshire's net worth at the time. Now imagine I'd made a third investment of $1.3 billion in something that went nowhere – say, a long-term bond that just sat there returning its modest interest. Fast forward to 2022, and here's what happened: our Coke position grew to $25 billion and Amex to $22 billion. Each now represents about 5% of Berkshire's total net worth. Meanwhile, that hypothetical bond investment would still be worth roughly $1.3 billion, which is now just 0.3% of our net worth – essentially irrelevant.\n\nDo you see what happened? I didn't need to be right about everything. I didn't even need to be right most of the time. Those two successful investments grew so large that they swamped the mediocre decision. The \"weed\" withered away in significance not because it disappeared, but because the \"flowers\" grew so magnificently that they changed the entire composition of the garden.\n\nThis happens through two mechanisms working together. First, there's the obvious growth in absolute value – $1.3 billion becoming $25 billion is roughly a 19-fold increase for Coke. Second, and this is what people miss, Berkshire itself was growing during this period. So even as these investments were compounding in value, the denominator – our total net worth – was also expanding. Yet despite that expanding denominator, Coke and Amex each still represent 5% of our net worth, the same as decades ago. They grew with us. The bond investment couldn't keep pace, so it shrank to insignificance.\n\nHere's why this matters so much for investors: you can afford to have some mediocre ideas in your portfolio, or even a few poor ones, as long as you also have a few outstanding ones and you don't sell them prematurely. The mathematics are forgiving if you let your winners run. Too many investors do the opposite – they sell their winners because they've \"gone up enough\" and hold onto their losers hoping they'll recover. This is exactly backward.\n\nThe other element I mentioned – starting early and living into your 90s – isn't just a joke. Time is the friend of wonderful businesses and the enemy of the mediocre. The longer you hold a truly great business, the more pronounced this flower-and-weed effect becomes. Coke's dividend to us grew from $75 million to $704 million over those years. That's the power of compounding working in your favor, year after year, just as certain as birthdays."

        "value": "I feel strongly about this because the current accounting rules, while well-intentioned, create a wildly distorted picture of what's actually happening in our business, and I've watched investors and media get confused by these numbers quarter after quarter. Let me explain why this matters and what it reveals about the difference between business reality and market noise.\n\nLook at the table I showed you from 2022. Our operating earnings – the actual cash we generated from our businesses – were relatively steady: $7.0 billion, $9.3 billion, $7.8 billion, and $6.7 billion across the four quarters. These numbers reflect what our insurance companies, railroads, utilities, and other businesses actually earned. They're real economic results. But the GAAP earnings we're required to report? They were $5.5 billion, negative $43.8 billion, negative $2.7 billion, and $18.2 billion. In the second quarter, GAAP said we lost $43.8 billion while our businesses were actually earning $9.3 billion. That's not a small discrepancy – it's absurd.\n\nThis happens because accounting rules now require us to include all the unrealized gains and losses from our stock portfolio in our earnings every quarter. When the stock market goes down, we report huge \"losses\" even though we haven't sold anything and our businesses are humming along just fine. When the market bounces back, we report enormous \"gains\" that also don't reflect any real change in our business performance. These paper gains and losses tell you something about stock market sentiment on any given day, but they tell you nothing about whether Berkshire is becoming more or less valuable as a business.\n\nHere's the deeper principle: there's a fundamental difference between business performance and stock price performance, and you need to understand which one you're looking at. Our operating earnings tell you about business performance – are our insurance companies writing profitable policies? Are our railroads moving more freight? Are our utilities serving customers efficiently? These are the questions that matter for understanding the long-term value creation at Berkshire.\n\nThe stock portfolio gyrations tell you about market sentiment, which is useful information over long periods but meaningless in the short term. Charlie and I know that capital gains will be hugely important to Berkshire over decades – they have been in the past and will be in the future. But trying to evaluate them quarterly or even annually is like trying to judge a baseball player's ability by whether he got a hit in his last at-bat. The sample size is too small and the randomness too great.\n\nThis distinction applies beyond Berkshire. When you're evaluating any business, you need to separate the signal from the noise. What are the fundamental economics of the business? Is it generating more cash? Are its competitive advantages strengthening or weakening? Is management allocating capital wisely? These are signal. What did the stock do this quarter? That's usually noise, especially in the short term.\n\nThe media doesn't help because they mindlessly headline whatever the GAAP number is. \"Berkshire loses $43 billion!\" makes for a dramatic headline, even though nothing of the sort actually happened. We didn't lose $43 billion any more than your house \"loses\" value when your neighbor's similar house sells for less than last month. The value is still there; only the quote changed.\n\nWhat I'm urging you to do is think like a business owner, not a stock trader. If you owned 100% of a private company, you wouldn't think you'd made or lost money every time someone offered you a different price for it. You'd look at whether the business itself was becoming more valuable – growing its earnings, strengthening its market position, building its capabilities. That's what operating earnings help you see. The GAAP earnings, with their wild quarterly swings, actually obscure this picture. They're worse than useless for understanding business performance; they're actively misleading."

        "value": "Float is one of the most beautiful aspects of the insurance business, and I'm glad you asked about it because it's central to understanding what makes Berkshire tick. Let me walk you through why this matters so much.\n\nFirst, let's be clear about what float actually is. When we collect premiums from policyholders, we don't pay out claims immediately. We hold onto that money – sometimes for years – until claims come due. That money sitting there, waiting to pay future claims, is float. Now here's the magic: while we're holding it, we can invest it. We can buy businesses, stocks, bonds, whatever makes sense. The earnings from those investments belong to Berkshire.\n\nThe really wonderful part is that if we underwrite disciplined policies – meaning we're careful about what risks we take on and what premiums we charge – this float can actually be cost-free over time. Think about that for a moment. It's like someone handing you money to use, and if you're smart about your insurance business, they're not charging you interest for it. In fact, over the years, we've sometimes had negative cost float, meaning people were essentially paying us to hold their money.\n\nNow, why isn't this recognized in our financial statements? Because accountants, quite properly, view float as a liability. After all, we do owe that money eventually when claims come in. But that's where conventional accounting misses the economic reality. Yes, it's technically a liability, but it's a liability that generally doesn't go away. As old policies expire and claims get paid, new policies come in with new premiums. The float persists and usually grows.\n\nWhen I say it's grown 8,000-fold since 1967, I'm talking about going from a few million dollars to $164 billion by the end of 2022. That's an enormous pool of money we've been able to invest over decades. The compounding effect of investing that float wisely has been extraordinary for Berkshire shareholders.\n\nHere's what makes our situation special, and this is where the Alleghany acquisition fits in beautifully. Berkshire's financial strength – our fortress balance sheet – means our insurance subsidiaries can pursue investment strategies that other insurers simply cannot. Most insurance companies are worried about short-term market fluctuations because they might need to sell investments at the wrong time to pay claims. We don't have that worry. We can invest for the long term, ride out market storms, and make concentrated bets when we see compelling opportunities.\n\nThe Alleghany deal added $17 billion to our float in a single year, taking us from $147 billion to $164 billion. That's not just a number on a page. That's $17 billion more that we can deploy into productive assets that will compound over time for shareholders.\n\nThe key lesson here is that not all liabilities are created equal. A liability that renews itself, costs you nothing or less than nothing, and gives you permanent capital to invest is actually an asset in disguise. It's one of the most durable competitive advantages in business, and it's why I fell in love with insurance so many decades ago."

        "value": "I used strong language there, and I meant it. There's so much confused thinking and deliberate misrepresentation around share repurchases that it drives me crazy. Let me break down the economics clearly, because this really isn't complicated if people think straight about it.\n\nThe fundamental principle is simple: when a company buys back its shares at a price below intrinsic value, the continuing shareholders benefit. When it buys back shares at a price above intrinsic value, the continuing shareholders are hurt. It's pure mathematics. If you and I own a business worth $100 million and there are 10 million shares outstanding, each share is worth $10. If the company buys back one million shares at $8 each, we've just spent $8 million to acquire something worth $10 million. The remaining shareholders now own a larger piece of the same pie, and they got that larger piece at a discount.\n\nThat's why I emphasized \"value-accretive\" repurchases in the letter. At Berkshire, we repurchased 1.2% of our shares in 2022, but only when we believed the price was below intrinsic value. Every remaining shareholder – and that includes Charlie and me and our families – now owns 1.2% more of every business Berkshire controls. We own more of our insurance operations, more of BNSF railroad, more of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, more of everything. Nobody was harmed. The selling shareholders got a fair price they were happy with, and the continuing shareholders increased their ownership.\n\nNow let's look at my auto dealership analogy, because it cuts through the political rhetoric. Imagine three people own a local car dealership equally. One partner wants to sell out. The dealership buys his stake at a fair price that makes sense for the two remaining partners. Has anyone been hurt? Of course not. The seller got what he wanted, and the two remaining partners now own more of the business. The manager isn't somehow enriched at the expense of the other continuing owner – they both benefit proportionally.\n\nThis is exactly what happens with corporate repurchases done right. The math doesn't change just because there are thousands of shareholders instead of three. Yet somehow, when we scale this up to public companies, people start making all sorts of wild claims.\n\nHere's where it goes wrong, and I want to be clear about this too: when companies overpay for repurchases, it's value-destructive. If that auto dealership paid $2 million for a third that's only worth $1 million, the continuing owners just lost money. And yes, this happens in corporate America. Sometimes CEOs buy back stock to prop up the price, to hit earnings-per-share targets that trigger their bonuses, or because some investment banker whispers in their ear that it's a good idea. When companies borrow money at high rates to buy back stock at inflated prices, that's foolish and harmful.\n\nBut the solution isn't to ban or demonize all repurchases. That's like banning all surgery because some surgeons are incompetent. The solution is for boards and managers to think clearly about value and only repurchase when it's accretive.\n\nI also mentioned that our ownership in Apple and American Express increased without any cost to us because those companies bought back their own shares. When you own a piece of a business that's shrinking its share count at sensible prices, you're getting richer. Tim Cook and Steve Squeri are increasing our ownership stake through their repurchase programs, and we don't pay a dime for it.\n\nThe political attacks on repurchases often come from people who either don't understand basic economics or who are pushing an agenda. They'll claim repurchases hurt workers or the public or that they only benefit CEOs. But that's nonsense if the repurchases are done at the right price. A company that's allocating capital wisely – whether that's reinvesting in the business, making acquisitions, paying dividends, or buying back stock – is creating value for all stakeholders over time."

When I say we treat shareholder money as our own, I mean exactly that. My family's wealth, Charlie's wealth, and the wealth of our close friends is overwhelmingly concentrated in Berkshire stock. We eat our own cooking, and we've been eating it for a very long time.\n\nThis creates a fundamentally different dynamic than you see at most public companies. When a CEO has most of his net worth tied up in stock options that vest over a few years, or when directors own token amounts of stock, their incentives diverge from yours as a shareholder. They might be tempted to boost short-term results to cash out, or to take excessive risks because they're playing with house money. That's not our situation. Every dollar of Berkshire's intrinsic value that gets destroyed hurts me and my family just as much as it hurts you.\n\nThe practical implications of this alignment run deep through everything we do. It means we don't manipulate earnings to hit quarterly targets. It means we don't make acquisitions to build an empire if they don't make economic sense. It means we don't pay ourselves excessive compensation or load up on perks. It means we think about capital allocation with the same care you'd use if you were investing your own life savings – because that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nThis is why our shareholders can become centimillionaires without studying the financials. They understand the fundamental proposition: their interests and ours are identical. When Berkshire does well, we do well. When Berkshire does poorly, we suffer right alongside everyone else. There's no way for us to win while shareholders lose.\n\nCompare this to the typical corporate structure. Management might own 1% of the company but control 100% of the decisions. They can pay themselves lavishly through salaries and bonuses regardless of shareholder returns. They can pursue strategies that enhance their personal prestige even if they destroy value. The misalignment is baked into the structure.\n\nI've seen this trust compound over the decades. Shareholders who bought in the 1970s or 1980s watched us navigate challenge after challenge – the textile business failure, various market crashes, the 2008 financial crisis. They saw that we never betrayed their trust, never tried to fool them with accounting gimmicks, never put our interests ahead of theirs. That track record matters enormously.\n\nThe beauty of this arrangement is its simplicity. Our shareholders don't need to be financial analysts. They don't need to parse footnotes or worry about whether management is playing games. They know the game we're playing is the same one they're playing. We're all trying to compound our capital over long periods, and we're all in the same boat. That's a promise we can make because our wealth is sitting right there in Berkshire stock, just like theirs. When you see that kind of alignment, trust becomes rational, not blind faith."

When CEOs manipulate numbers to \"beat expectations,\" they're not demonstrating skill or business acumen – they're simply lying. And the fact that this lying has become normalized, even celebrated, tells you something has gone seriously wrong in our business culture.\n\nLet me be clear about what's happening here. Manipulating earnings requires no talent whatsoever. Any competent accountant can find ways to shift revenue between quarters, capitalize expenses that should be written off, or use reserves to smooth results. It's not sophisticated – it's dishonest. When a CEO described his deception to me as \"bold imaginative accounting,\" he was dressing up fraud in fancy language. That kind of euphemistic thinking is corrosive.\n\nThe damage extends far beyond any individual company. When earnings manipulation becomes widespread, investors lose the ability to distinguish good businesses from bad ones. Financial statements become works of fiction rather than reliable scorecards. Capital gets misallocated because investors are making decisions based on false information. Companies that are actually performing well get lumped in with companies that are just good at accounting tricks.\n\nThink about the incentive structure this creates. Young managers see their bosses getting rewarded for hitting numbers through manipulation. They learn that \"making the quarter\" matters more than building long-term value. They discover that Wall Street analysts and reporters play along with the game, praising companies that beat expectations by a penny through accounting maneuvers. Pretty soon, the honest managers start to feel like chumps. Why should they report truthfully when their competitors are inflating their results?\n\nThis is how you get the corporate scandals we've seen over the decades. Enron didn't start with massive fraud – it started with small manipulations that became normalized, then escalated. When the culture accepts that beating expectations through accounting is fine, you've removed an important guardrail. The line between aggressive accounting and fraud becomes blurry.\n\nThe role of directors and advisors in enabling this behavior particularly bothers me. Boards are supposed to protect shareholders, but too often they go along with management's games. Advisors who should know better provide intellectual cover for deception. Everyone acts like this is just how the game is played. Well, it shouldn't be.\n\nWhat really gets lost is the purpose of financial reporting. The whole point is to give owners an accurate picture of how their business is performing. When I read Berkshire's financial statements, I want to know the truth about our operations, even if that truth is uncomfortable. How else can I make intelligent decisions about capital allocation? How else can our shareholders evaluate whether we're doing a good job?\n\nThe celebration of \"beating expectations\" is particularly absurd. If a company consistently beats analyst estimates, that tells you one of two things: either the analysts are incompetent, or management is managing expectations and manipulating results. Neither reflects well on anyone involved. Yet this game continues quarter after quarter, with everyone pretending it's meaningful.\n\nCapitalism's great strength is that it allocates resources efficiently when people have good information. Earnings manipulation corrupts that information flow. It turns financial markets into casinos where the house is dealing from a marked deck. That's not capitalism working properly – it's capitalism being undermined from within. And when enough people lose faith in the integrity of financial reporting, the whole system suffers. That's why this isn't just about individual bad actors. It's about protecting the foundations of the system that has created more prosperity than any other in human history."

They're inseparable.\n\nThe Tailwind has been becalmed from time to time, that's true. We've had periods where things looked pretty grim. But its propelling force has always returned. Always. That's not blind optimism; it's pattern recognition based on nearly a century of observation. The dynamism of the American system – the way it allows for creative destruction, rewards innovation, and channels capital to its most productive uses – creates conditions where businesses like Berkshire can thrive.\n\nSo when I emphasize our tax payments, I'm really making a statement about the symbiotic relationship between successful businesses and successful societies. We owe the country no less than our fair contribution. The system works, and it works because enough people and institutions support it. I don't expect any reader of my letters to have a different experience in the future. The American Tailwind will keep blowing, and those who position themselves to benefit from it – while contributing back to it – will continue to do well."

        "value": "Charlie's observation cuts right to the heart of what separates truly great businesses from everything else. What he's saying is that a great company has a durable competitive advantage and a business model so robust that it continues generating value regardless of who's managing it on any given day. A mediocre company, by contrast, requires constant intervention, brilliant management decisions, and heroic efforts just to maintain its position.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When Charlie and I evaluate a business, we're not just looking at current earnings or even growth rates. We're asking ourselves: what happens if we buy this company and then the management goes on vacation for five years? Does the business keep humming along, serving customers, maintaining its competitive position, and generating cash? Or does it immediately start losing ground to competitors?\n\nThink about some of the businesses we own. See's Candies has been selling chocolates for over a century. The brand, the recipes, the customer loyalty, the seasonal buying patterns – these things are embedded in the business itself. Management matters, certainly, but the business model works almost automatically. People want to buy boxed chocolates for gifts, especially around holidays, and See's has earned their trust over generations. That trust doesn't evaporate if the CEO takes a month off.\n\nCompare that to a mediocre company – maybe a retailer with no particular competitive advantage, or a manufacturer in a commodity business. These companies are constantly fighting for survival. They need brilliant merchandising decisions every season, or perfect operational execution every quarter, or they need to undercut competitors on price continuously. The moment management takes its foot off the gas, the business starts sliding backward. These companies don't work after you're not working; they require constant effort just to stay in place.\n\nThis insight shapes our capital allocation in profound ways. We're willing to pay substantial premiums for great companies precisely because they have this self-sustaining quality. We're not buying a job for ourselves; we're buying a stream of earnings that will continue regardless of our daily involvement. That's why we can own dozens of businesses without Charlie and me being involved in their day-to-day operations. We've chosen businesses that keep working.\n\nIt also explains why we stubbornly hold our investments for a long time, as Charlie mentions. If you own a great company, why would you sell it? It's going to keep creating value year after year. The weighing machine that Ben Graham talked about will eventually recognize that value. But if you own a mediocre company, you're in a different situation entirely. That's when Charlie's advice about not bailing away in a sinking boat applies – if you can swim to a seaworthy vessel, you should.\n\nThe practical application for investors is this: spend your time identifying businesses with durable competitive advantages, strong business models, and the ability to generate returns without requiring genius-level management. These are the companies that will make you rich while you sleep. Don't fool yourself into thinking you can turn a mediocre business into a great one through superior management or hard work. As Charlie would say, that's like trying to bail water out of a sinking boat. Your effort would be better spent finding a boat that doesn't leak in the first place. The great companies keep working after you're not, and that's the kind of business we want to own forever."

        "value": "This is one of the most difficult challenges in investing, and I'll be honest with you – Charlie and I struggled with it for decades when it came to railroads. The key is understanding that being consistent in your principles doesn't mean being rigid in your conclusions. Your framework for thinking should remain stable, but your specific judgments must evolve as facts change.\n\nLet me explain what happened with railroads. For most of our careers, Charlie and I avoided railroad stocks like the plague. We had very good reasons. The industry was characterized by brutal competition, heavy capital requirements, poor returns on invested capital, and a history of bankruptcies. Railroads were the poster child for what we call a \"capital-intensive, low-return business.\" We watched railroad after railroad destroy shareholder value, and we learned our lesson well – maybe too well.\n\nBut here's what changed: consolidation. The country went from dozens of competing railroads to four major systems of vital importance to the American economy. This wasn't a trivial change. These railroads now had pricing power they'd never possessed before. They became essential infrastructure with rational competition rather than suicidal price wars. The economics of the business fundamentally transformed. When we finally recognized this – and yes, we were slow – we acted. We bought BNSF, and it's been a wonderful investment for Berkshire.\n\nThe lesson here is about intellectual honesty and humility. You need to constantly ask yourself: \"What would change my mind about this?\" You should have a clear understanding of the facts and conditions that support your current view. Then you need to monitor whether those conditions still hold true. This requires real work and real honesty with yourself.\n\nThe danger comes in two forms. First, you can be too quick to abandon sound principles when they're temporarily out of favor. We see this all the time – investors who chase whatever's hot and abandon their discipline. That's not adaptation; that's just being blown around by the wind. Second, you can be too stubborn, clinging to old conclusions even when the underlying facts have changed. That's what we did with railroads for too long.\n\nHow do you find the balance? You need a partner or a process that challenges you. This is why Charlie and I work so well together. When one of us gets too attached to an old idea, the other pushes back. Charlie's line about \"You're smart and I'm right\" is funny, but it's also profound. It means we're both bringing our full intellectual capacity to the problem, but we're also willing to override each other's initial instincts when the facts demand it.\n\nThe practical application is this: write down why you believe what you believe. Be specific about the conditions that make your investment thesis valid. Then, regularly review whether those conditions still exist. If they've changed materially, you need to reconsider your position. It's not flip-flopping; it's intellectual integrity. As Keynes said, \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\""

        "value": "The See's Candy example demonstrates a business that \"hasn't been materially altered in 101 years\" yet continues to thrive. What makes this kind of business valuable, and how should investors think about businesses that don't need to constantly reinvent themselves?"

        "value": "The See's Candy story is one of my favorite illustrations of what makes a truly great business, and it's worth understanding deeply because it goes against much of what you hear in the business press today. Everyone talks about disruption and innovation and reinvention, but some of the best businesses are the ones that don't need to change at all.\n\nLet me start with what See's really represents. When we bought See's in 1972 for twenty-five million dollars, a lot of people thought we overpaid. The company had only about eight million in tangible assets. But what we were really buying was something intangible and incredibly valuable: a brand that people trusted and loved, with a product that created happy memories and traditions. That's a moat – a durable competitive advantage that protects the business from competition.\n\nNow, here's the beautiful part. See's sells essentially the same chocolates and peanut brittle today that it sold when Henry Ford was making Model T's. We haven't had to spend billions on research and development. We haven't had to constantly reinvent the product. We haven't faced the risk that our entire business model becomes obsolete. Instead, we've simply maintained quality, treated customers well, and let the brand compound in value over time.\n\nThink about what happened at our shareholder meeting. See's rang up about ten sales per minute during prime operating hours – over $400,000 in two days from a single location. These weren't people buying because of some clever new marketing campaign or because we'd revolutionized the chocolate business. They were buying because See's means something to them. It represents quality, tradition, and happy occasions. That meaning has been built up over more than a century, and it can't be replicated quickly by a competitor.\n\nThis is what Charlie and I look for: businesses with enduring competitive advantages that don't require constant capital investment to maintain their position. Compare See's to a technology company that needs to spend enormous sums every year just to stay current, where your product might be obsolete in five years, where competitors can come out of nowhere and destroy your market position. See's doesn't face those risks.\n\nThe economic beauty of this model is extraordinary. See's generates substantial cash that we don't have to reinvest in the business. We can take that cash and deploy it elsewhere in Berkshire's operations. Over the decades, See's has generated well over two billion dollars for us from that initial twenty-five million dollar investment. That's the power of a business that doesn't need to change.\n\nNow, I'm not saying innovation is bad or that all businesses should stay static. Some businesses must innovate to survive – that's the nature of their industry. But investors often overlook the profound value in businesses that have staying power, that solve the same human needs year after year in the same reliable way. People will always want to give gifts, celebrate special occasions, and enjoy treats. See's satisfies those timeless needs.\n\nThe practical lesson for investors is this: don't be seduced by complexity or constant change. Sometimes the best investment is in a simple business that does one thing very well and has done it for a very long time. Look for businesses with strong brands, loyal customers, and products that don't need to be reinvented. Look for businesses where the competitive advantage is durable, not dependent on being first to market with the next new thing. These businesses might not be exciting, but they can be extraordinarily profitable and far less risky than businesses that must constantly reinvent themselves to survive."
