When I talk about being disgusted by certain CEOs, I'm not criticizing them for making business mistakes – we all make those, and I've made plenty. What disgusts Charlie and me is the misalignment of interests, the hypocrisy, and the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose arrangements that have become far too common in corporate America.\n\nLet me be crystal clear about my mistakes. I managed most of Berkshire's equity portfolio poorly for several years. I also allowed General Re to take on business without proper safeguards, and September 11th exposed that error. These were genuine mistakes in judgment, and they cost our shareholders money. But here's the critical difference: those mistakes cost me exactly the same as they cost you. I own over 99% of my net worth in Berkshire stock. My wife and I have never sold a share. When Berkshire's performance suffers, my net worth suffers proportionally to yours. We're in the same boat, and I'm rowing right alongside you.\n\nNow contrast that with the situation I'm criticizing. You had CEOs who were urging investors to buy shares while they were secretly dumping their own stock. They were using stock options and compensation packages that allowed them to walk away with extraordinary wealth even as their companies collapsed and shareholders lost billions. Some were even hiding their selling through various methods. That's not a mistake – that's a betrayal. They viewed shareholders as patsies, not partners.\n\nThe joke I mentioned about the CEO who wants his options repriced captures this perfectly. When a company's stock falls, shareholders lose money – period. But many CEOs wanted to be insulated from that same consequence. They wanted their options repriced so they could still profit even though shareholders were suffering. It's the ultimate in having your cake and eating it too.\n\nCharlie and I have structured things differently by design. We take no cash compensation beyond my nominal salary. We don't grant ourselves restricted stock or options that would make our results superior to yours. This isn't because we're saints – it's because it's the only honest way to run a company. If we're asking you to trust us with your capital, we need to be eating our own cooking.\n\nWhen I make a mistake, I'll tell you about it, just as I'm doing here. I'll explain what went wrong and what we're doing to fix it. But you can be absolutely certain that any mistake that hurt you hurt me more in absolute dollars. That's the promise we make: your economic result from Berkshire will parallel ours during your period of ownership.\n\nThe business leaders I'm criticizing weren't making honest mistakes while aligned with shareholders. They were systematically enriching themselves at shareholder expense, often through deception. That's not an error in judgment – it's an error in character. And that's a distinction that matters enormously."

        "value": "You state that Berkshire won't come close to replicating its past record due to higher valuations and much more capital to deploy. Why should shareholders focus on relative performance versus the S&P 500 rather than absolute returns, and how does this perspective help investors think about future expectations?"

        "value": "This is one of the most important concepts for investors to understand, yet it's one that many people resist. Some folks say \"you can't eat relative performance,\" and in a narrow sense, they're right. But that misses the entire point of how intelligent investing actually works over time.\n\nLet me start with the basic logic. Charlie and I expect that owning the S&P 500 will produce reasonably satisfactory results over time. That's our baseline assumption. If that's true – and history strongly supports it – then consistently beating that index by even small margins must prove rewarding over a long period. It's simple mathematics. If the S&P returns 10% annually and we return 12% annually, that 2% advantage compounds into enormous wealth over decades.\n\nThink about the See's Candy analogy I used. See's loses considerable money during the summer months when people aren't buying much chocolate. But over the full year, it's highly profitable, and you can eat very well indeed from owning that business. The seasonal losses don't matter – what matters is the full-year result. Similarly, absolute investment returns will vary dramatically from year to year based on market conditions. Some years everything goes up, some years everything goes down. But if you're consistently beating the index through those cycles, you're accumulating real wealth.\n\nHere's why this matters so much right now for Berkshire shareholders. I'm telling you plainly that we won't come close to replicating our past record. Two huge factors have changed. First, when we were working with small amounts of capital, we could buy businesses and securities at much lower valuations than exist today. We could find wonderful opportunities that moved the needle. Second, and more important, we're now working with enormous amounts of capital. It's simply harder to generate high percentage returns on large sums.\n\nThis is mathematical reality, not an excuse. If I have $1 million to invest, I can find opportunities that might return 50% or more. If I have $100 billion to invest, those same opportunities are rounding errors. I need to find elephant-sized deals, and elephants don't often sell at bargain prices.\n\nSo what should you expect? You should expect that we'll strive for above-average performance versus the S&P 500. We won't be satisfied with less. But you shouldn't expect the 20%+ annual returns of our early decades. Those days are gone, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either deluded or dishonest.\n\nThis is where relative performance becomes your friend. If the market returns 8% and we return 10%, you're building wealth. If the market falls 20% and we fall 15%, you're preserving capital better than the alternative. Over time, these advantages compound significantly.\n\nThe practical implication is this: don't judge Berkshire – or any investment – by whether it made money in absolute terms in any given year. Judge it by whether it's doing better than the relevant alternative. If we're beating the S&P 500 consistently, even by modest margins, we're doing our job. Your wealth will grow faster than it would in an index fund, and that's what matters.\n\nThis perspective also protects you from the biggest mistake investors make: abandoning good investments during temporary downturns. If you understand that relative performance is what counts, you won't panic when the market falls and we fall with it, as long as we're falling less."

        "value": "You mention that your cost of float was \"terrible\" in 2001 and \"too high\" in recent years after historically being very low or even negative. What determines whether an insurance operation creates value or destroys it, and why is the cost of float such a critical metric for evaluating insurance businesses?"

        "value": "An insurance business creates value when its cost of float over time is less than what the company would otherwise pay to obtain funds through normal financing channels. It destroys value when the cost of float exceeds market rates for money. It's really that simple, though many people in the insurance industry lose sight of this fundamental principle.\n\nLet me walk you through the economics. Float is money we hold but don't own – it comes from premiums customers pay us before we have to pay out claims. Sometimes that interval stretches over many years, particularly in lines like workers' compensation or certain liability coverages. During that time, we get to invest this money and keep the investment returns. Now, that sounds wonderful, and it can be. But here's the catch: the premiums we collect usually don't cover the losses and expenses we eventually must pay. That shortfall – the underwriting loss – represents the cost of our float.\n\nThink of it this way. If we collect one hundred million dollars in premiums and eventually pay out one hundred and five million in losses and expenses, we've run a five million dollar underwriting loss. That five million is what we paid to use that hundred million of float for whatever period we held it. Now we need to calculate whether that cost is attractive compared to what we'd pay to borrow money or raise capital through other means.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've been fortunate. In about half the years we've operated, our cost of float has actually been less than zero. We've been paid to hold other people's money because we ran an underwriting profit. When you can generate billions of dollars of float at no cost – or better yet, at negative cost – and then invest those funds at reasonable returns, you've got a magnificent business. This is the engine that has powered much of Berkshire's success.\n\nBut when the cost of float rises above market rates for funds, the insurance operation becomes what I call a lemon. You're paying more for money than you need to, and that destroys value. This is why I was so concerned about our performance in 2000 and 2001. When our cost of float hit six percent and then got even worse, we were no longer running an advantageous operation.\n\nThe critical point for evaluating any insurance company is understanding these three factors: how much float the business generates, what it costs, and most importantly, what the long-term outlook is for both. You can't just look at premium volume or market share. An insurer writing lots of business at inadequate prices is heading for trouble. The discipline to maintain a low cost of float, even if it means sacrificing growth, separates the great insurance operations from the mediocre ones. That's the lesson I had to relearn, and it's why we've worked so hard to improve our underwriting discipline."

What does this teach us about the importance of trusting exceptional managers, and how should investors and business owners think about the balance between their own judgment and deferring to people with superior knowledge in specific areas?"

        "value": "The R.C. Willey story illustrates one of the most important lessons in business: when you find truly exceptional managers with proven track records in their field, you need to defer to their judgment even when your own instincts tell you otherwise. I was dead wrong about Sundays, and Bill Child was absolutely right. The new store didn't just succeed – it outsold every other store in the chain and did twice the volume I had anticipated.\n\nHere's what makes this lesson so valuable. I had a theory based on what seemed like logical reasoning. R.C. Willey had built a wonderful business in Utah while staying closed on Sundays, respecting the values of its predominantly Mormon customer base and employees. When Bill wanted to open a store in Boise, Idaho, I figured the same approach would work. After all, if it succeeded in Utah, why change the formula? But I was applying a general principle without understanding the specific circumstances. Bill knew his business and his market. He understood that Boise's demographics were different, that Sunday closing would put the store at a severe competitive disadvantage, and that the formula needed to adapt to local conditions.\n\nThe key is knowing when to trust someone else's judgment over your own. This isn't about being wishy-washy or lacking conviction. It's about intellectual honesty and recognizing the limits of your own knowledge. Bill Child had earned the right to be trusted. He'd built R.C. Willey into a phenomenally successful operation through decades of excellent decision-making. He knew furniture retailing in ways I never would. When someone with that kind of track record in their specific domain tells you something, you'd better listen carefully.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean you should defer to everyone about everything. The art is in distinguishing between managers who truly know their business and those who are simply confident. Bill had decades of proof. He'd demonstrated sound judgment repeatedly. He understood his customers, his employees, his competitors, and his economics. That's very different from someone with a plausible-sounding theory but no track record.\n\nWhat I love about this story is that it also shows the importance of admitting when you're wrong. I tried to take credit for the Boise store's success at the grand opening, just like I'd done in Boise itself. It didn't work – people knew the truth. And that's how it should be. There's no shame in being wrong; the shame is in not learning from it or in failing to give credit where it's due.\n\nFor investors and business owners, the lesson is clear: hire exceptional people, give them authority in their areas of expertise, and have the humility to defer to their judgment even when it contradicts your own instincts. But – and this is important – choose those people very carefully based on their track record and demonstrated ability. When I say \"What does Bill think?\" now, it's not a joke. It's a recognition that in his domain, his judgment is better than mine. That's not weakness; that's wisdom. And notice I drew the line at closing on Saturdays – even good managers don't get unlimited deference. You still need to think for yourself about the big picture."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The insurance business is fundamentally different from most industries because you're getting paid today for a promise to pay tomorrow, and you won't know your actual costs for years. That's a recipe for disaster if you lack discipline, regardless of how big you are or how famous your name is.\n\nThink about it this way: In most businesses, you know your costs upfront and then try to sell your product for more. If you're Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble, your size gives you purchasing power, distribution advantages, and brand loyalty that translate directly into profits. But in insurance, you're essentially writing a check to yourself today and promising to cover unknown costs in the future. The person who writes the most business isn't necessarily the winner – in fact, they're often the loser if they've mispriced their risk.\n\nThis is why size can actually work against you in insurance. Large companies feel pressure to maintain market share, to keep their agency relationships strong, to keep premium volume up to satisfy Wall Street. When prices start falling in the market – and they always do cyclically – these big players often follow the market down because they're afraid of losing business. They tell themselves they can make it up in investment income, or that they need to maintain relationships, or that this competitor's price must be right because they're smart too. It's all nonsense, but it's comforting nonsense that lets them keep writing business they shouldn't write.\n\nBrand name doesn't help you either, because insurance is largely a commodity product. A policy is a policy. The person buying it cares about price and whether you'll pay claims, but if you're a big, established company, the claims-paying ability is assumed. So competition devolves into price, and that's where discipline matters everything. The brand doesn't give you pricing power the way Coca-Cola's brand does.\n\nNow look at our three principles of underwriting discipline. First, staying within your circle of competence means saying \"no\" constantly. It means watching business walk out the door to competitors. A big company with a big sales force hates doing that. Second, limiting aggregation of risk means turning away business even when it looks profitable on its face, because you're worried about correlation. Again, that takes discipline that's easier for a focused operator than a company trying to write billions in premiums. Third, avoiding moral risk means firing customers, even profitable-looking ones, when you smell something wrong. Large companies often have too many layers and too much bureaucracy to catch these situations early.\n\nThe beautiful thing about underwriting discipline is that it's available to anyone. You don't need capital to have it – you need character. You don't need market share – you need patience. You don't need a famous brand – you need the willingness to look foolish when competitors are writing business you've walked away from. And that's why small, focused insurers with disciplined management often produce better results than the giants. The giants have the resources, but they lack the discipline to use them properly. In insurance, discipline trumps resources every single time."

        "value": "That phrase \"we brought upon ourselves\" is important because it reflects a hard truth: the September 11th losses weren't just bad luck – they revealed underwriting mistakes we'd made before the towers fell. We had written business we shouldn't have written, and the terrorist attacks exposed those errors in the most painful way possible.\n\nHere's what happened. In the years leading up to 2001, the insurance market had become extremely competitive. Prices were falling, terms were loosening, and we got caught up in it more than we should have. Particularly at General Re, which we'd acquired in 1998, there was business on the books that violated our second principle – limiting aggregation of losses from a single event. When those planes hit the towers, we discovered we had way too much exposure concentrated in one location. We had multiple policies that could all be triggered by the same event, and we hadn't properly understood or limited that correlation.\n\nThis gets to something crucial about insurance: the risks you write today are like seeds you're planting. You collect the premium immediately – that feels good, it increases your float, it makes your revenue look great. But you won't know if you planted weeds or flowers until years later when the claims come in. On September 11th, we discovered we'd planted some weeds.\n\nThe lesson here connects directly to our first principle about staying within your circle of competence. We thought we understood the risks we were writing, but we didn't fully appreciate how multiple policies could correlate in a single catastrophic event. Terrorism wasn't something we'd properly evaluated as a \"remote loss scenario.\" We'd looked at each policy individually and thought we were fine, but we hadn't done the hard work of imagining how seemingly unrelated policies could all blow up at once.\n\nThis is why I said we'd need a low cost of float going forward, especially with interest rates so low. When government bonds yielded 6% or 8%, you could afford some underwriting sloppiness because your investment income would bail you out. You could run a combined ratio of 105 or 106 and still make money. But when short-term funds earn less than 2%, you can't afford that luxury anymore. You need an underwriting profit, period. Every mistake shows up in your results with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe experience also reinforced our third principle about moral risk, though in a different way. The moral risk isn't always about dishonest policyholders – sometimes it's about our own behavior. When we write business we don't fully understand just to maintain market share or relationships, we're being dishonest with ourselves. We're pretending we know things we don't know. That's a moral failure of discipline.\n\nAfter September 11th, we went back through our book of business with a much harder eye. We walked away from business we'd previously written. We tightened terms dramatically. We accepted that our premiums would shrink. And yes, we looked foolish to competitors who kept writing business at prices we wouldn't touch. But that's the price of discipline – you have to be willing to look wrong in the short term to be right in the long term.\n\nThe ultimate lesson is this: in insurance, your mistakes don't show up immediately, but they always show up eventually. September 11th was our report card on underwriting decisions we'd made years earlier, and we didn't like the grade we received. That's why discipline can't be situational or temporary – it has to be constant and unfailing, even when the market is competitive and you're watching business go elsewhere."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons we've learned in the insurance business, and it cost the industry dearly on September 11th. The fundamental answer is that experience tells you what has happened, while exposure tells you what could happen. And in insurance, you're getting paid today to take on risks that will unfold tomorrow, so you'd better be thinking about what's possible, not just what's occurred.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When you look at historical experience, you're essentially looking in the rearview mirror. If you're writing property insurance and you study the last fifty years, you'll see losses from fires, windstorms, earthquakes, and explosions. You can calculate average losses, worst-case scenarios from past events, and build what looks like a pretty solid pricing model. The problem is that you're assuming the future will resemble the past. And sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAt General Re, we made exactly this mistake with terrorism risk. We looked at our experience and saw no major terrorism losses in our property book. So we essentially priced that risk at zero. We weren't thinking about exposure—about what could happen given the nature of modern terrorism, the concentration of values in major cities, and the potential for coordinated attacks. We received no premium for a risk that turned out to be enormous.\n\nNow, I'm not saying experience is worthless. Far from it. If you're writing earthquake insurance in California, you absolutely want to know the seismic history. That data has real utility, especially when you're writing broad coverage across the entire state. The law of large numbers works in your favor there, and historical patterns do tell you something meaningful about future probabilities.\n\nBut here's where it gets dangerous: experience looks best precisely when exposure is often at its worst. Take the D&O insurance example I mentioned. Late in a bull market, your loss experience looks terrific. Claims are down, settlements are reasonable, and you might think you've got a great business on your hands. But that's exactly when exposure is exploding. Companies are going public with ridiculous business models, executives are manipulating earnings, stock promotions take on a chain-letter quality, and all sorts of unsavory behavior is happening beneath the surface. The rising stock market is hiding a multitude of sins.\n\nWhen the market turns, all of this comes home to roost. Suddenly you've got massive investor losses, angry shareholders looking for someone to blame, and juries that are quite happy to transfer wealth from big insurance companies to small investors who've been hurt. One jumbo verdict can reset the landscape for all future settlements. If you priced based on the benign experience of the bull market, you're going to get killed.\n\nThe right approach is to always ask yourself: what is my actual exposure here? What could go wrong? What new risks exist that haven't shown up in the historical data? Sometimes the correct price based on exposure might be five times what experience would suggest. And if you can't get that price, you shouldn't write the business. It's that simple."

      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "This is a principle that applies far beyond insurance, but it's absolutely critical in our business. The simple truth is that no contract is strong enough to compensate for doing business with someone who lacks integrity. And in insurance, where we're often dealing with claims that involve judgment calls and good faith, the character of the people on the other side of the transaction matters enormously.\n\nLet me explain why this is so fundamental. Insurance is a business built on trust and future promises. We collect premium today and promise to pay claims tomorrow—sometimes many years from tomorrow. The policyholder, in turn, promises to be truthful in their application, to maintain certain standards, to notify us of changes in risk, and to deal honestly with us when claims arise. These aren't just legal obligations; they're moral ones. And when you're dealing with someone who doesn't share that moral framework, you're in trouble before you start.\n\nThe problem with bad actors is that they're creative. They'll find ways to game the system that you haven't anticipated. They'll exploit ambiguities in contract language. They'll manufacture claims or inflate losses. And here's the kicker: the cost of dealing with this behavior is almost always higher than you expect. You'll spend money on investigations, legal fees, and extended disputes. You'll pay claims you shouldn't have to pay because it's cheaper than fighting. And worst of all, you'll have tied up management time and attention on problems that never should have existed in the first place.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something. The vast majority of our policyholders and clients are honorable and ethical people. We've done business with thousands of wonderful individuals and companies over the years, and those relationships have been profitable and pleasant for both sides. But the exceptions—the few bad apples—can be extraordinarily expensive. One bad relationship can wipe out the profits from dozens of good ones.\n\nThis connects to the broader challenge of risk assessment in an important way. When you're underwriting a risk, you're trying to evaluate two things: the probability of loss and the magnitude of potential loss. But there's a third factor that's often overlooked: the integrity of the counterparty. This affects both probability and magnitude. A dishonest policyholder is more likely to have a claim, and that claim is more likely to be inflated or even fraudulent.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this principle applies to every aspect of business, not just insurance. At Berkshire, we've walked away from acquisitions where the economics looked attractive but we had doubts about the people involved. We've avoided investments in companies where management's integrity was questionable. And we've been proven right time and time again. The few times we've ignored warning signs about character, we've regretted it.\n\nThe practical application is straightforward: be very selective about who you do business with. Check references thoroughly. Pay attention to reputation. And when you see red flags—even small ones—take them seriously. It's much better to pass on a potentially profitable transaction than to get involved with the wrong people. As we say in Omaha, you can't make a good deal with a bad person. The math just doesn't work, no matter what price you charge or what terms you negotiate. Character matters, and in insurance, it matters more than almost anything else."

The principle is brutally simple: it doesn't matter how smart you are or how clearly you see a problem coming if you don't act on that knowledge. Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does.\n\nLet me be very direct about what happened at Berkshire. I understood before September 11th that terrorism posed an incalculable risk to the insurance industry. I knew that insurers had been blithely writing policies without properly considering these exposures. I recognized that the probabilities, while low, were not zero, and that the potential losses could be catastrophic. But here's the thing – I didn't translate that understanding into action. We continued to operate, particularly at General Re, with what I now recognize was a dangerous level of risk for which we weren't being adequately compensated.\n\nThis gets to something fundamental about human nature and business management. There's an enormous gap between intellectual recognition and operational change. It's easy to nod your head at a risk assessment. It's much harder to actually restructure your business, turn down premium income, and explain to your organization why you're walking away from business that looks profitable on the surface. The inertia of existing operations is powerful. You tell yourself, \"Well, nothing's happened yet,\" or \"Maybe the risk isn't as bad as I think,\" or \"We'll deal with it next quarter.\"\n\nThe consequences of this failure were severe. When September 11th occurred, Berkshire took losses of $2 billion to $2.5 billion – losses for which we had not been properly compensated through adequate premiums. That's a real cost to our shareholders, and it resulted directly from my failure to act on what I already knew.\n\nNow, what should we learn from this? First, in business, action is what counts. Analysis without implementation is worthless, perhaps even dangerous because it gives you a false sense of security. You think you've addressed a problem because you've thought about it, but thinking doesn't protect you when disaster strikes.\n\nSecond, there's a time value to risk management. Every day I delayed in restructuring our exposures was another day we remained vulnerable. Risk doesn't wait for you to get around to addressing it. The right time to build the ark is before the rain starts, not when you see the first drops falling.\n\nThird, this experience reinforced for me the importance of having systems and people in place who will force action, not just analysis. At Berkshire, we've since become much more disciplined about ensuring that when we identify a risk, we immediately move to either price it properly, limit our exposure, or exit the business entirely.\n\nThe Noah rule sounds simple, almost folksy, but it represents one of the most important distinctions in business management – the difference between the appearance of prudence and actual prudence. I failed that test before September 11th, and it cost us dearly."

The willingness to accept volatility doesn't mean accepting any risk at any price.\n\nHere's why our capacity creates competitive advantage. Most insurers and reinsurers simply cannot stomach the kind of losses we can absorb. They don't have the capital base, they don't have the earnings power from non-insurance businesses to cushion the blow, and most importantly, they don't have shareholders who understand and accept volatility. When you can't afford to take big losses, you can't write certain kinds of business at all, or you have to share the risk with others, which dilutes your returns.\n\nThink about what we bring to the table. We have massive liquid resources – real money sitting there ready to pay claims. We have substantial earnings from our non-insurance businesses, which means a bad year in insurance doesn't threaten the enterprise. We have a favorable tax position that many competitors don't enjoy. And critically, we have shareholders who understand that our earnings will be volatile and who won't panic when we report a large loss.\n\nThis combination is extraordinarily rare in the insurance industry. It means we can write business that others simply can't touch. When someone needs to place a risk that could result in a billion-dollar loss, there aren't many doors they can knock on. We're one of the few, and we can charge accordingly.\n\nBut now let me explain what makes this rational. First, we must be paid properly. If the premium doesn't adequately compensate us for the risk, we walk away, no matter how large the premium might be in absolute terms. Second, we must understand the risk we're taking. We're not willing to bet the company on risks we can't analyze or understand. Third, we must ensure that no single event or series of related events can threaten Berkshire's existence. We can lose $2 billion to $2.5 billion and remain strong; we cannot and will not take risks that could impair our fundamental financial strength.\n\nThe discipline required here is immense. It's tempting, when you have large capital and risk-bearing capacity, to simply write lots of business and collect lots of premiums. But that's not what we do. We're highly selective. We turn down far more business than we accept.\n\nWhat makes this approach powerful is that it's sustainable. We're not trying to maximize this year's profits or this quarter's premium volume. We're trying to earn appropriate returns over time on the risks we assume. Some years we'll have no large losses and will look very profitable. Other years we'll have significant losses. But over time, if we price properly and select carefully, we'll earn good returns – returns that reflect both our analytical capabilities and our rare capacity to absorb volatility that would cripple our competitors."

        "value": "This is one of the most important questions in the insurance business, and frankly, it's something that keeps me up at night because the pattern repeats itself over and over across the industry. The fundamental problem is that intelligent, competitive people can convince themselves they're being disciplined when they're actually making terrible decisions.\n\nLet me walk you through what happens. You've got talented professionals who are paid to write business and who naturally want to succeed. They're sitting across the table from a broker or client, and they know their competitors are offering terms. The human instinct is to find a way to say \"yes\" – to win the business, to maintain the relationship, to keep their market share. Now, they're not consciously deciding to write bad business. Instead, they start making small adjustments in their thinking. Maybe they tell themselves this particular risk is different, or that their modeling is more sophisticated than the competition's, or that the relationship will pay off in the long run. Each individual decision seems reasonable in isolation.\n\nBut here's the insidious part: in long-tail insurance, you don't know you're wrong for years. If you're running a grocery store and you sell items below cost, you'll figure it out pretty quickly when you run out of cash. In reinsurance, you can write policies at inadequate prices for three, four, five years and your reported results will look fine. You're collecting premiums today, and the losses won't fully develop until much later. This delayed feedback loop is absolutely deadly because it allows bad practices to become embedded in the organization.\n\nAt General Re, we had a compounding problem: they didn't reserve correctly, which meant they didn't even know their true costs. Imagine trying to run any business when you don't know what your product actually costs. You might think you're pricing at a profit when you're actually selling at a substantial loss. In long-tail reinsurance, this ignorance doesn't just cause problems – it's dynamite, as I said in the letter.\n\nThe competitive dynamic makes everything worse. When your competitors are writing business at inadequate prices, and you're the one saying \"no,\" it feels like you're losing. Your production goes down, your market share shrinks, and people start questioning whether you're being too conservative. The pressure builds, both external and internal. Pretty soon, \"winning\" gets redefined as market share rather than underwriting profit, and that's when you're in real trouble.\n\nSo how do you prevent this? First, you need leadership that genuinely believes underwriting profit matters more than volume. That's why we brought in Joe Brandon – someone with the backbone to say \"no\" and mean it. Second, you need to measure and compensate people based on underwriting results, not just premium volume. Third, you need the financial strength to walk away from business, which is where Berkshire's capital base gives us an enormous advantage. We can afford to wait for good opportunities.\n\nMost importantly, you need to remember that in insurance, you're not competing to write the most business. You're competing to write the most profitable business. That distinction sounds obvious, but it's remarkable how often smart people forget it when they're in the heat of competition."

Our competitive advantage isn't that we're smarter than everyone else or that we have some secret formula. It's that we're structured in a way that allows us to be rational when others can't afford to be.\n\nLet me break down why this matters. Most insurance companies operate under constraints that force them to avoid certain risks, even when those risks are attractively priced. They might have limited capital, so one bad year could threaten their ratings or their existence. They might have shareholders who panic when earnings are volatile, forcing management to smooth results and avoid lumpy risks. They might have tax positions that make large losses particularly painful. Or they might have debt covenants that restrict their flexibility.\n\nBerkshire has none of these problems. We have massive liquid resources, which means we can write enormous policies without worrying about whether we can pay the claims. We have substantial non-insurance earnings from our operating businesses, so our insurance operations don't have to produce steady results every single year. We have a favorable tax position that gives us additional flexibility. And most importantly, we have you – shareholders who understand that volatility isn't the same thing as risk, and who won't stampede for the exits if we have a terrible year.\n\nThis combination is genuinely unique. There's no other insurance operation in the world with all these characteristics. And it allows us to do something very valuable: we can write risks that are profitable over time but might produce terrible results in any given year. Think about insuring against catastrophic terrorism losses or massive natural disasters. These are real risks that need to be insured, and customers will pay meaningful premiums for coverage. But most insurers can't stomach the possibility of a huge loss in a single year, even if the long-term odds are in their favor.\n\nHere's the key insight: when you can tolerate volatility that others can't, you get paid for it. It's similar to investing in stocks versus bonds. Stocks are more volatile, but over long periods, they've provided higher returns. That extra return is essentially compensation for tolerating volatility. In insurance, we're getting compensated for our willingness to accept lumpy results.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something: tolerance for volatility doesn't mean recklessness. We will not knowingly expose Berkshire to losses beyond what we can comfortably handle. We will control our total exposure, no matter what the competition does. The key word there is \"comfortably.\" What we can handle comfortably is far larger than what most companies can handle at all, but there are still limits.\n\nThe beauty of this model is that it's self-reinforcing. Because we can write big risks profitably, we generate more capital, which allows us to write even bigger risks. Because we have patient shareholders, we can focus on long-term results rather than quarterly earnings. Because we have diverse earnings streams, we can weather storms in any single business. It all fits together.\n\nOver time, this advantage compounds. We're not trying to write the most business or gain the most market share. We're trying to write profitable business that others can't or won't write. Some years will be terrible – that's inevitable when you're insuring catastrophic risks. But over decades, this approach should produce excellent results. That's the power of being able to think and act long-term in a world where most participants are forced to focus on the short term."

When we retain our risks and depend on no one, we eliminate what I call \"daisy chain risk,\" and this distinction becomes absolutely critical when the world goes to hell in a handbasket.\n\nLet me explain how this works. Most insurance companies don't keep all their risk. They pass some of it along to reinsurers, who may then pass portions to other reinsurers, creating what we call a retrocessional chain. Now, here's the problem: this chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Imagine you're an insurance company that's done everything right – you've underwritten carefully, priced appropriately, and bought reinsurance protection from what appears to be a solid company. But that reinsurer has laid off some of its risk to another company, which has done the same to yet another. If any link in that chain breaks – if one company can't pay – the losses flow backward through the chain like a row of falling dominoes.\n\nThe real danger emerges when you combine a major catastrophe with a terrible economic environment. This isn't theoretical speculation; it's precisely when insurance claims spike that economic conditions often deteriorate simultaneously. Think about it: a massive hurricane doesn't just create insurance losses. It disrupts business, destroys property, and can trigger broader economic problems. During these exact moments when you desperately need your reinsurance protection to work, you might discover that some company three or four links down the chain has gone belly-up, and suddenly your \"protection\" is worthless.\n\nThat's what I mean when I say you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out. In good times, everyone looks solvent. The reinsurance chain appears strong. Companies collect premiums and pay modest claims, and the whole system hums along nicely. But apply a real stress test – imagine a catastrophic event during a severe recession or financial crisis – and you'll discover which companies actually have the financial strength to pay and which were just going through the motions.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've structured Ajit's operation to eliminate this risk entirely. We retain our risks. We don't depend on anyone else's promise to pay. When we write a policy, we have the resources to pay the claim, period. Our checks will clear regardless of what's happening in the economy or the insurance industry. This isn't machismo; it's basic risk management.\n\nThis independence carries another crucial advantage: we can write business that others can't or won't touch. When a client needs truly reliable protection for an enormous risk, they can come to Berkshire knowing we won't be looking to pass that risk along to some questionable third party. Our willingness and ability to retain risk is itself a competitive advantage. It's why Ajit's business is so valuable and why his underwriting principles – which include this fundamental independence – will never waver regardless of how the business ebbs and flows."

        "value": "The GEICO situation in 2001 illustrates something really important about insurance economics that many people misunderstand. We had what most people would consider a terrific year – premium volume up 6.6%, float growing by $308 million, and an underwriting profit of $221 million. But I called our inability to add policyholders \"an important disappointment,\" and I meant it. Let me explain why both things are true.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what we accomplished. When an insurance company achieves an underwriting profit, it means we're being paid to hold other people's money. Think about that for a moment. GEICO collected premiums from customers, set aside reserves for future claims, invested that money, and still had $221 million left over after paying all claims and expenses. So we got to use $4.25 billion in float – money that doesn't belong to us but that we can invest – and we were actually paid $221 million for the privilege. That's extraordinary. Most insurers operate at an underwriting loss, meaning they pay for the float they use.\n\nThis cost-free float is the holy grail of insurance. It means every dollar of investment income we earn on that $4.25 billion is pure profit. We're not subtracting underwriting losses from our investment gains. The insurance operation stands on its own profitably, and the investment income is gravy. When you combine cost-free float with Berkshire's investment capabilities, you create a compounding machine that's hard to match.\n\nBut here's why the policyholder count matters so much: float is a function of scale. If we're not growing our policyholder base, we're limiting our future float growth. Yes, we added $308 million in float during 2001, but imagine what we could do if we were adding policyholders at a healthy clip. Our preferred customer base grew only 1.6%, while our standard and non-standard policies actually fell 10.1%. Overall, we lost ground in policy count.\n\nThis matters because GEICO has genuine competitive advantages. Tony and his team run the operation with costs far below our major competitors. Our prices are attractive to customers. We're achieving underwriting profits while others struggle. In this environment, we should be taking market share hand over fist. The fact that we weren't adding policyholders meant we were leaving opportunity on the table.\n\nThe constraint wasn't capital or capability – Tony and I were eager to spend much more than the $219 million we put into marketing. The problem was effectiveness. We couldn't figure out how to deploy more marketing dollars in ways that would generate profitable new business. This is a high-class problem, but it's still a problem. When you have a competitive advantage, you want to press it as hard as you can.\n\nNow, the good news in the excerpt is that we were seeing improvement. Our closure rate from telephone inquiries was climbing, and our Internet business was growing steadily. These trends suggested we'd see at least modest policy growth in 2002. But \"modest\" wasn't what we were shooting for with GEICO's advantages.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about the multiple dimensions of insurance success. Underwriting profit is crucial – it determines whether your float is an asset or a liability. But growth matters too, especially when you're operating with structural advantages like GEICO's low costs. The ideal scenario is profitable underwriting combined with rapid, sustainable growth in policies and float. In 2001, we had the profitability piece working beautifully, but we were temporarily stuck on the growth piece. That's why I could simultaneously praise the results and express important disappointment. Both perspectives were necessary to understand the complete picture."

When an insurer discovers that its reserves were inadequate, the losses didn't suddenly \"develop\" in the current year – they were sitting there all along, unrecognized. What actually happened is that management miscalculated, plain and simple. Using fancy terminology to dress up errors is exactly the kind of obfuscation that prevents clear thinking and accountability.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. When you're running an insurance company, loss reserves represent your estimate of what you'll ultimately have to pay out for losses that have already occurred. This isn't money set aside – it's a liability, a debt you owe. Getting this number right is absolutely critical because if you underestimate your reserves, you're fooling yourself about your true costs. You'll think you're making money when you're actually losing it, and you'll keep selling policies at inadequate prices, digging yourself deeper into a hole. That's exactly what happened at GEICO in the early 1970s, and it nearly destroyed the company.\n\nNow, when an insurer later discovers its reserves were too low, the industry has developed this comfortable language to describe the problem. They say losses \"developed\" or that they're \"strengthening\" reserves. But think about what those words imply. \"Development\" sounds like something that happens naturally, like a photograph developing in a darkroom or a child developing into an adult. It suggests an external process beyond anyone's control. \"Strengthening\" sounds positive and proactive, like you're building up something that was already adequate. Both terms deflect responsibility and obscure what really happened.\n\nThe reality is much simpler and less flattering: management got it wrong. At General Re in 2001, we had to recognize $800 million in losses that had actually occurred in prior years. Those losses existed all along – we just failed to see them. Our error had serious consequences. We paid incentive compensation based on profits that were illusory. We paid income taxes earlier than necessary. And most importantly, we priced our policies inadequately because we thought our costs were lower than they truly were.\n\nThis is why I'm so insistent on clear, honest language in business. Words matter. When you use euphemisms to describe mistakes, you make it easier to repeat them. You create a culture where errors are viewed as natural occurrences rather than failures of judgment that need to be corrected. Can you imagine an insurer that found its reserves too high describing the adjustment as \"reserve weakening\"? Of course not – because that would sound bad, even though it's the logical opposite of \"reserve strengthening.\"\n\nThe lesson here extends far beyond insurance terminology. In business and investing, you need to call things what they are. When management makes a mistake, say so. When earnings were overstated, admit it. Clear thinking requires clear language, and clear language requires intellectual honesty. Anytime you find yourself reaching for comfortable euphemisms to describe uncomfortable realities, you should stop and ask yourself what truth you're trying to avoid facing."

When you underestimate your loss reserves, you're not just making an accounting mistake – you're creating a false reality that leads to bad decisions across the board. And here's the thing: these weren't dishonest people cooking the books. This was an honest mistake, but honest mistakes in insurance can be just as devastating as dishonest ones.\n\nLet me explain the cascade of consequences. It starts with the reserve calculation itself. You're trying to estimate what you'll ultimately pay for losses that have occurred but haven't been fully settled. Some claims have been reported but not paid. Others – the IBNR claims – haven't even been reported yet. Someone might have been exposed to asbestos or a product defect years ago, and the claim won't surface for decades. This is genuinely difficult work, and I don't want to minimize that difficulty.\n\nBut here's where the error multiplies. When General Re underreserved by $800 million, management thought their insurance policies were costing far less than they actually were. Imagine you're running a store and you think your cost of goods is $80 when it's really $88. You'll price your products to make a profit on $80, but you're actually losing money on every sale. The more you sell, the worse off you become. That's exactly what happened – we sailed blissfully along, as I put it, selling more and more policies at ever-larger losses while thinking we were profitable.\n\nThe consequences spread further. We paid substantial incentive compensation based on those overstated profits. People received bonuses for performance that never actually occurred. We paid income taxes earlier than necessary because we reported income we hadn't really earned. Every financial decision was based on a false foundation, and the longer the error persisted, the more damage it caused.\n\nNow, what should investors look for when evaluating an insurer's reserving practices? First, look at the track record. Does the company consistently have to take large charges for prior-year losses? That's a red flag suggesting management either can't estimate accurately or is intentionally lowballing reserves to inflate current earnings. Second, look at the trend. Small adjustments are normal – reserving is an estimate, after all – but large, recurring shortfalls indicate a systematic problem.\n\nThird, and this is critical, look at management's candor when discussing reserves. Do they use euphemisms like \"loss development\" or do they call it what it is – an estimation error? Do they explain what went wrong and what they're doing to fix it? Management that speaks clearly about mistakes is more likely to learn from them.\n\nThe broader lesson is about the nature of insurance itself. It's a business where you receive money upfront and pay claims later, sometimes much later. This creates an enormous temptation to underreserve because it makes current results look better. The bill doesn't come due until later, possibly on someone else's watch. That's why reserving discipline and intellectual honesty are so essential in insurance. Without them, you're building a house of cards.\n\nFor investors, the key insight is this: in insurance, reserve adequacy isn't just an accounting issue – it's a window into management's competence and integrity. If they can't or won't estimate their liabilities accurately, they can't price their product correctly, and they can't run the business successfully. It's that fundamental."

The auditor gets a letter from management that protects the auditing firm if those numbers turn out to be wrong later, but there's no real independent verification of whether the reserves are adequate. It's like a student grading their own test and the teacher just accepting whatever score they write down.\n\nNow, this creates a particularly dangerous situation when you have a company that's struggling financially. Think about it from the perspective of management at a troubled insurer. They look at their books and realize that if they reserve properly for all the claims they're likely to face, they'll have to report losses that could put them out of business immediately. They're essentially being asked to prepare their own execution papers. Human nature being what it is, most people aren't going to do that willingly.\n\nSo what happens? Management becomes a very lenient grader on their own exam. They convince themselves that maybe things won't be as bad as they fear. They find reasons to believe that claim costs will be lower than historical patterns suggest. They tell themselves they're being reasonable when they're actually being optimistic. And remember, the auditor isn't really in a position to challenge this aggressively because the auditor doesn't have better information than management does about what future claims will cost.\n\nThis is why I mentioned that major underreserving is common in cases of companies struggling for survival. When you're drowning, you grasp at any straw that might keep you afloat a little longer. Proper reserving would mean admitting you're going under, so management underreserves, hoping that somehow things will turn around or that they'll be able to deal with the problem later.\n\nThe \"rented suit\" story illustrates this perfectly. You think you've paid for something completely, but there are these ongoing costs you didn't account for. In insurance, these hidden costs can stay buried for decades before they surface. Asbestos claims are the classic example – policies written in the 1960s and 1970s created liabilities that didn't fully manifest until the 1980s and beyond.\n\nThe broader lesson here is about the importance of incentives in business. When you create a system where management grades its own performance, and where honest grading could mean immediate catastrophe, you're going to get dishonest grading. It's not always outright fraud – often it's just wishful thinking that becomes institutionalized. But the result is the same: reserves that are inadequate, earnings that are overstated, and eventually, a reckoning that's far more painful than if the company had faced reality from the start.\n\nThis is why at Berkshire we've always tried to be conservative in our reserving, even though we've made mistakes ourselves. We'd rather have unpleasant surprises that turn out better than expected than pleasant surprises that turn out worse."

        "value": "The idea of discounting insurance reserves might sound sophisticated and financially precise, but it's actually dangerous nonsense. Yes, it's true that a dollar you'll pay ten years from now is worth less than a dollar today in present value terms. That's basic finance. But discounting only makes sense when you can precisely establish what you're going to pay and when you're going to pay it. With insurance reserves, you simply can't do that, and pretending you can is a recipe for disaster.\n\nLet me explain why insurance liabilities are so fundamentally different from, say, a bond payment. When a company issues a bond, it knows exactly what it will pay and exactly when. There's a contract that specifies every detail. But when an insurance company writes a policy, it's making a promise to pay for losses that haven't happened yet, under terms that will be interpreted by courts that haven't ruled yet, for injuries that will be treated with medical procedures that haven't been invented yet, at costs that haven't been incurred yet.\n\nThe forces working against accurate reserve estimation are powerful and they all push in one direction – making reserves inadequate. Judicial interpretation of policy language tends to broaden over time, not narrow. Courts find coverage in policies where insurers never intended to provide it. Medical costs inflate faster than general inflation. New theories of liability emerge. Think about asbestos again – when those policies were written, nobody imagined the scale of liability that would eventually emerge.\n\nThis is what I mean when I say that surprises in the insurance world have been far from symmetrical. When a claims manager walks into my office and says \"Guess what just happened,\" I'm not expecting good news. I'm not expecting him to tell me that a court just narrowed the interpretation of our policies, or that medical costs came in lower than expected, or that juries suddenly became more conservative in their awards. It doesn't work that way. The surprises are almost always bad, almost always costly, and almost always mean that our previous estimates were too optimistic.\n\nSo when someone proposes discounting reserves, they're essentially saying: \"Let's take these numbers that we know are probably too low to begin with, and let's make them even lower by applying a discount rate.\" It's compounding error upon error. You're taking an inherently uncertain and probably understated liability and making it look smaller on your balance sheet. That might make your current earnings look better, but it doesn't change reality. Those claims will still need to be paid, and when they are, they'll cost what they cost.\n\nThe prudent approach – the only sensible approach – is conservatism. You need to recognize that you're dealing with enormous uncertainty, that the forces at work tend to increase costs rather than decrease them, and that you're better off overestimating your liabilities than underestimating them. This isn't just good accounting; it's good business. An insurance company that consistently underreserves is lying to itself and its shareholders about its true financial condition. Eventually, reality catches up, and the reckoning is severe.\n\nThis is why we've always erred on the side of caution at Berkshire. We've told you when we've underreserved in the past, and we work hard to avoid it. We'd rather have our reserves prove redundant than deficient, because we're in this business for the long haul, and long-term success requires facing reality, not hiding from it."
