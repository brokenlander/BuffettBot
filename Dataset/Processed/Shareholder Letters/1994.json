        "value": "This is one of the most important mathematical realities in investing, and I want to be completely honest with our shareholders about it. When Charlie and I started managing Berkshire with about $22 million in net worth, we could find dozens of opportunities where we could deploy $1 million, $5 million, or $10 million and move the needle significantly on our returns. Now, with $11.9 billion in net worth, those same opportunities are essentially meaningless to us. It's simple arithmetic, really.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic. If we find a wonderful business where we can invest $5 million and double our money, that's a $5 million gain. When we had $22 million in capital, that gain represented nearly 23% of our net worth - very meaningful. But with $11.9 billion in capital, that same $5 million gain represents about 0.04% of our net worth. It barely registers. We could make a hundred such investments and still not move the performance needle in any significant way. This is why we've had to establish a minimum threshold of $100 million for investments we'll consider. Even at that size, we'd need to make many of them to impact our overall results.\n\nThe investment universe shrinks dramatically as you move up in size. There are thousands of businesses where you could intelligently deploy $1 million. There are hundreds where you could deploy $10 million. But there are far fewer where you can sensibly put $100 million to work, and fewer still where you can deploy $500 million or $1 billion. It's like a funnel that keeps getting narrower.\n\nThis creates a real tension in our business. Our past success has created the very condition that makes it harder to replicate that success. The 23% compounded annual growth rate we achieved over 30 years simply cannot continue. It's mathematically impossible. If we could somehow maintain that rate, Berkshire would eventually own everything in the world! The numbers become absurd very quickly.\n\nBut here's what's critical - and this is where Charlie's wisdom really shines through. He reminds me that \"if something is not worth doing at all, it's not worth doing well.\" We're not going to abandon our principles just to put money to work. We're not going to make mediocre investments in businesses we don't understand, or pay foolish prices, simply because we need to deploy capital. That would be letting the size of our wallet dictate our investment decisions, which is exactly backward.\n\nInstead, we're going to stick with our formula: buying good businesses with sound economics, run by honest and able people, at sensible prices. This approach will produce reasonable success, though not the spectacular returns of the past. We'll wait patiently for opportunities in our \"happy zone,\" as Ted Williams would say. We won't swing at bad pitches just because we have money burning a hole in our pocket. The discipline to wait for the right opportunity becomes even more important as you get larger, not less important. We'd rather have our capital sit idle than deploy it foolishly. That's the honest reality of managing a large amount of capital."

        "value": "This goes to the very heart of how Charlie and I think about investing, and it's one of the most liberating principles we've ever embraced. The simple truth is that nobody can predict macro events with any consistency, and more importantly, you don't need to predict them to succeed in investing. Let me explain why this matters so much.\n\nLook at the list of major events from the past thirty years that I mentioned: the massive expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks, a president resigning, the Soviet Union dissolving, the Dow dropping 508 points in a single day, and Treasury bill yields swinging wildly between 2.8% and 17.4%. Thirty years ago, if you'd told people these things would happen, they'd have thought you were crazy. Nobody predicted this sequence of events. Nobody could have.\n\nNow here's the key insight: despite all these dramatic, world-changing events, Ben Graham's investment principles worked perfectly well throughout. The idea of buying good businesses at sensible prices remained sound. The concept of margin of safety didn't become obsolete. The principle of treating stocks as fractional ownership of businesses rather than ticker symbols continued to work. None of these blockbuster events changed the fundamental nature of what makes a good investment.\n\nThis tells us something profound: the macro events that dominate headlines and consume so much attention are largely irrelevant to the patient, fundamental investor. They're noise, not signal. And here's where it gets really interesting - trying to predict these events, or worse, trying to position your portfolio based on predictions about them, is enormously expensive. It's expensive in terms of the time and mental energy wasted. It's expensive in terms of the advisory fees paid to people who claim they can forecast the future. And it's most expensive in terms of opportunity cost.\n\nImagine if we had sat on our hands in the 1970s because we were worried about oil shocks or inflation. Imagine if we'd refused to invest in the 1980s because we were concerned about the Cold War. Imagine if we'd gone to cash before we could predict the 508-point drop in the Dow. The cost to us would have been enormous. We would have missed out on purchasing wonderful businesses at sensible prices during those periods.\n\nIn fact - and this is something I want to emphasize - we've usually made our best purchases when apprehensions about some macro event were at a peak. When everyone else is frightened about the big picture, prices tend to be more attractive. Fear drives prices down. This is why I say that fear is the foe of the faddist but the friend of the fundamentalist. The faddist, who's chasing trends and trying to predict the next big thing, gets paralyzed by scary headlines. But the fundamentalist, who's focused on business value, sees opportunity.\n\nOur approach is to focus entirely on what we can actually analyze and understand: the economics of specific businesses, the quality of their management, and the price we're paying relative to value. These are things we can evaluate with some degree of confidence. Whether interest rates will be 3% or 8% next year, whether there will be a war in some part of the world, whether a new political party will take power - these things are both unpredictable and, for our purposes, largely irrelevant.\n\nI can promise you that major shocks will occur in the next thirty years. I have no idea what they'll be, and I'm not going to waste time trying to guess. We'll just keep doing what we do: looking for good businesses at fair prices and holding them for the long term."

        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons Charlie and I learned over our careers, and it took us longer than it should have to figure it out. When I was younger, I was trained by Ben Graham to look for cheap stocks – what I called \"cigar butts.\" You'd find a company selling below working capital, buy it, get one puff out of it, and move on. That worked fine when I was managing small amounts of money, but it's a terrible way to build lasting wealth.\n\nThe Hope diamond principle represents a fundamental shift in our thinking. What we came to understand is that a wonderful business – and by wonderful I mean one with strong economics, enduring competitive advantages, and excellent management – will compound your wealth year after year. A mediocre business, even if you buy it cheap, will give you mediocre results at best and often requires constant attention and capital just to stay afloat.\n\nLook at the examples I mentioned in that letter. Through our 7.8% stake in Coca-Cola, we essentially own a piece of a business that sells 280 billion servings a year and makes a penny on each one. Now, a penny doesn't sound like much, does it? But when you multiply small margins by enormous volume in a business with incredible brand strength and global distribution, those pennies become nearly $200 million in earnings attributable to Berkshire. And here's the key: Coke doesn't require proportional capital investment to grow. The brand does the heavy lifting.\n\nCompare that to owning 100% of some struggling manufacturer that needs constant capital expenditures, faces intense competition, has no pricing power, and delivers mediocre returns. You might have paid a cheap price for it, but you're going to get cheap results. You'll spend your time and energy managing problems rather than watching a great business compound.\n\nThe same principle applies to Gillette and Wells Fargo. With Gillette, we own 7% of the world's razor and blade market – a business with fantastic unit economics where customers need to repurchase regularly. With Wells Fargo, our 13% stake gives us the economics of running a $7 billion bank, but without the headaches of actually managing thousands of employees and branches.\n\nThis approach also ties into our long-term holding period. When you own pieces of truly exceptional businesses, time becomes your friend. The compounding works in your favor year after year. But when you own mediocre businesses, time is your enemy – you're constantly fighting competitive pressures and economic gravity.\n\nThe mathematics are straightforward but powerful. If you own a wonderful business earning high returns on capital, and it can reinvest those earnings at similarly high returns, you get geometric growth. If you own an average business earning average returns, you get arithmetic growth at best. Over decades, the difference becomes astronomical.\n\nSo we'd much rather own 7% or 10% or even 1% of a spectacular business than 100% of a mediocre one. The key is identifying those rare gems – businesses with strong competitive moats, pricing power, capital-light growth, and management we trust. When we find them, we buy as much as we can and hold on for decades."

        "value": "The alignment between managers and owners is absolutely fundamental to how we operate at Berkshire, and frankly, it's something I feel strongly about because I've seen so many companies get it wrong. When Charlie and I ran investment partnerships in the 1960s, we established a principle that has guided us ever since: we eat our own cooking, and we sit on the same side of the table as our partners.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. In corporate America, you see all sorts of compensation schemes that create what economists call \"agency problems.\" Managers get stock options that give them huge upside if the stock goes up, but no downside if it goes down. They get bonuses based on short-term metrics that may not reflect long-term value creation. They get golden parachutes that pay them handsomely even if they fail. These arrangements fundamentally misalign interests.\n\nAt Berkshire, Charlie and I own our stock just like you do. We bought it with our own money, we hold it through thick and thin, and we benefit or suffer based on the same metric you do: the change in intrinsic value per share over time. We don't have stock options. We don't have special classes of stock with superior voting rights. We don't pay ourselves large salaries or bonuses. Our wealth rises and falls with yours.\n\nThis alignment affects every decision we make. When we're thinking about acquiring a business, we're not asking \"Will this boost earnings per share next quarter?\" or \"Will this make our stock price jump so my options vest?\" We're asking \"Will this increase the per-share intrinsic value of Berkshire over the long term?\" That's the same question you should be asking as a shareholder.\n\nThe fact that our personal fortunes remain overwhelmingly concentrated in Berkshire shares reinforces this alignment. We're not diversifying into other investments while asking you to stay concentrated in Berkshire. Many of our family members and friends from our old partnerships are also heavily invested in Berkshire. This creates a powerful incentive structure – we simply cannot afford to be careless or short-term oriented because we'd be hurting ourselves and people we care about.\n\nThis principle extends to how we think about risk. We're never going to bet the company on some risky venture because we're betting our own fortunes. We structure Berkshire to be financially impregnable because that's how we'd want it structured if we were passive shareholders. We maintain enormous liquidity and conservative debt levels not because we're timid, but because we're protecting what belongs to us and to you equally.\n\nThe alignment also affects our communication with shareholders. We try to report to you the same way we'd want to be reported to if our positions were reversed. We share both good news and bad. We explain our mistakes. We give you the information we'd want if we were in your shoes.\n\nI've seen too many companies where management treats the business as their personal fiefdom, where they pay themselves richly regardless of results, where they make acquisitions to build empires rather than value, where they obscure bad news and hype mediocre results. That behavior stems from misalignment. When managers can win even if shareholders lose, you get predictably bad behavior.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've eliminated that misalignment. Our interests are your interests. If we do well, you do well. If we mess up, we suffer alongside you. This isn't just good ethics – though it is that – it's also good business. It focuses us on what really matters: building per-share value over the long term."

        "value": "This is one of the most fundamental principles that Charlie and I have learned over our decades in business, and it took us longer than it should have to figure it out. The mathematics are actually quite simple, but they're counterintuitive to many people who think ownership percentage is what matters most.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic. If you own 100% of a business that earns a 4% return on equity, you're getting 4% on your investment. But if you own 13% of a business earning 20% on equity, like our stake in Wells Fargo, you're earning 20% on your proportionate share. The quality of the business matters far more than your percentage ownership. In the Wells Fargo example I mentioned, our 13% of a $53 billion bank gave us a \"$7 billion Berkshire Bank\" earning about $100 million in 1994. That's an outstanding return on a world-class financial institution.\n\nNow, why does this matter so much? Because truly exceptional businesses are rare gems, as I called them. They have durable competitive advantages, excellent management, strong returns on capital, and the ability to reinvest earnings at high rates of return. These businesses compound your wealth over time in ways that mediocre businesses simply cannot. A mediocre business might give you your money back, but a great business gives you your money back many times over.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way through Berkshire itself. When we bought Berkshire in the 1960s, we owned 100% of a textile business, and that 100% ownership was nearly worthless. The business was sub-profitable, and as I noted, the assets had neither going-concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. We were in complete control of something that was destroying value. That's a terrible position to be in, no matter how much of it you own.\n\nThe contrast with our partial ownership in businesses like Coca-Cola and Gillette couldn't be starker. We don't control these companies, but we don't need to. They have superb management, powerful brands, and economics that allow them to earn exceptional returns on capital. Our job is simply to identify these rare gems and hold significant positions in them. Over time, as these businesses increase in value, our stakes increase proportionately.\n\nThis philosophy has completely shaped how we think about capital allocation at Berkshire. We're not trying to own 100% of everything. We're trying to own meaningful stakes in the best businesses we can find, whether that's through complete ownership of subsidiaries or significant minority stakes in publicly traded companies. The key is the quality of the business, not the percentage we own. I'd rather own 10% of a business worth $10 billion that's growing at 15% annually than 100% of a business worth $1 billion that's stagnant or declining. The math is simple, but it took me years of making mistakes to truly internalize this lesson."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The distinction between book value and intrinsic value is absolutely fundamental to intelligent investing, yet it's widely misunderstood. Book value is what accountants can measure with precision—it's historical cost, what you paid for assets minus liabilities. Intrinsic value is what those assets are actually worth based on the future cash flows they'll generate. These two numbers can diverge dramatically, and understanding why is essential.\n\nLet me explain using the examples from my letter. In 1964, Berkshire's book value was precisely $19.46 per share. That number was accurate from an accounting standpoint, but it was essentially meaningless for investment purposes because it overstated what the business was actually worth. All our resources were tied up in a textile business that was sub-profitable. The intrinsic value was far below book value because those textile assets couldn't generate adequate returns. As I joked, when someone asked about our balance sheet, the appropriate response might have been, \"Don't worry, the liabilities are solid\"—meaning the assets were the problem!\n\nToday, Berkshire's situation has completely reversed. Our book value significantly understates our intrinsic value because many of the businesses we control are worth far more than their accounting carrying values. A business like See's Candies, for instance, might have modest book value, but it generates wonderful cash flows year after year, making its intrinsic value many multiples of what's on our balance sheet.\n\nNow, why does this matter so much? Because intrinsic value is what you should actually care about as an investor or business owner. I define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. This is admittedly fuzzy—it requires estimates of future cash flows and assumptions about discount rates, both of which will change over time. But despite this fuzziness, intrinsic value is all-important. It's the only logical way to evaluate whether an investment makes sense.\n\nThe college education analogy illustrates this beautifully. The \"book value\" of an education is what it costs, including foregone earnings while you're in school. But the intrinsic value is the present value of the additional lifetime earnings that education generates. Two students might have identical \"book values\"—they paid the same tuition and gave up the same earnings—but vastly different intrinsic values depending on what they studied, how hard they worked, and what careers they pursued.\n\nFor investors, this means you must always be thinking about future cash-generating ability, not historical costs. A company might have paid very little for a brand name decades ago, giving it minimal book value, but if that brand generates enormous cash flows, its intrinsic value is immense. Conversely, a company might have paid dearly for assets that appear impressive on the balance sheet but generate poor returns.\n\nAt Berkshire, we report book value because it's calculable and serves as a rough tracking measure for our intrinsic value. Last year they moved together—both up about 13.9%. But shareholders should understand that book value is just a starting point for analysis, not the destination. The real question is always: What are these businesses worth based on their future earning power? That's the question Charlie and I ask ourselves constantly, and it's the question every intelligent investor should be asking."

        "value": "Book value is essentially an accounting artifact that tells you what's been put into something, not what you can get out of it. And that's the fundamental problem with relying on it as a measure of worth. Think about it this way: book value is backward-looking, it's historical cost, it's what someone paid. Intrinsic value is forward-looking, it's about future cash flows, it's what something will produce.\n\nThe education example really crystallizes this. When you calculate the book value of an education, you're just adding up tuition, room, board, books, maybe the opportunity cost of not working for four years. That's your investment, your cost. But that number tells you absolutely nothing about whether that education was worth it. To figure out the real value, you need to estimate all the extra earnings that graduate will make over their lifetime because of that degree, and then discount those future earnings back to today at an appropriate interest rate. That's intrinsic value. And here's the kicker: sometimes the book value exceeds the intrinsic value, meaning you overpaid for something that won't deliver returns. Other times, intrinsic value far exceeds book value, which is exactly what you want.\n\nNow let's look at Scott Fetzer, because this is where the rubber meets the road. We paid $315.2 million for a company with a book value of only $172.6 million. We paid nearly double book value! If you were a traditional Graham-and-Dodd investor looking only at book value, you'd think we were crazy. But we weren't buying book value, we were buying earning power. We were buying businesses that could generate substantial cash flows year after year.\n\nLook at what happened. In 1986 alone, Scott Fetzer earned $40.3 million and paid us dividends of $125 million because it had excess cash. Over the next eight years shown in that table, the company earned between $40 million and $79 million annually. Meanwhile, the book value bounced around, sometimes going up, sometimes going down, depending on how much we took out in dividends versus how much the company retained. By 1994, book value was just $94 million, actually lower than when we bought it, despite the company having earned hundreds of millions of dollars in the interim.\n\nHere's the point: if you'd been watching book value, you'd have completely missed the story. The book value went down from $172.6 million to $94 million, yet we'd pulled out enormous dividends and the businesses were still churning out $79 million a year in earnings. The intrinsic value of Scott Fetzer was far higher than its book value when we bought it, and it stayed far higher throughout this period, even as book value declined. Book value is just an accounting number that moves around based on dividends and retained earnings. Intrinsic value is about the cash-generating capability of the business. That's what we paid for, and that's what we got. The book value number was essentially meaningless in understanding what we owned."

Let me walk you through the thinking here, because it goes to the heart of capital allocation.\n\nWhen we bought Scott Fetzer in 1986, it had excess cash sitting on the balance sheet. That cash was earning maybe five or six percent in short-term investments. Meanwhile, Berkshire had all sorts of opportunities to deploy capital at much higher rates of return. So in that first year, even though Scott Fetzer only earned $40.3 million, it paid us dividends of $125 million. We were simply moving cash from a place where it would earn low returns to a place where we could earn high returns. That's intelligent capital allocation, pure and simple.\n\nNow, notice what happened to book value. It dropped from $172.6 million to $87.9 million in that first year. If you didn't understand what was going on, you might think the business had been damaged or destroyed value. But nothing of the sort happened! The operating businesses were just as strong as ever. We'd simply moved cash from Scott Fetzer's bank account to Berkshire's bank account. The earning power of World Book, Kirby, and Campbell Hausfeld hadn't changed one bit.\n\nOver the subsequent years, you see this pattern continue. Some years Scott Fetzer paid out more in dividends than it earned, other years less. The book value bounced around like a yo-yo, from $87.9 million up to $133.3 million, then back down to $90.7 million. But here's what didn't bounce around: the earning power kept growing steadily from $40.3 million to $79.3 million over those nine years. That's what mattered.\n\nThis illustrates a crucial principle: the right dividend policy depends entirely on where capital can be most productively employed. If Scott Fetzer had wonderful opportunities to reinvest its earnings at high rates of return, we'd have been delighted to have it retain everything and pay us nothing. But if it had more cash than it could deploy effectively, the intelligent thing was to send it up to Berkshire where we could put it to work. There's no magic formula that says you should retain X percent or pay out Y percent. It all depends on opportunity.\n\nI also want you to notice what we didn't do. We didn't leverage up Scott Fetzer's balance sheet to pay ourselves bigger dividends. We didn't do sale-leasebacks of plants or sell off receivables or play any financial engineering games. The company actually went from modest debt to virtually no debt. We were simply harvesting the cash that the businesses naturally generated and moving it to where it could be most productive.\n\nThis is why I get frustrated when people focus on book value or dividend payout ratios as if they're meaningful in themselves. They're not. What's meaningful is earning power and intelligent capital allocation. Scott Fetzer's book value told you nothing about the value of what we owned. The earnings trend and our ability to redeploy those earnings intelligently, that's what created value for Berkshire shareholders. Book value is just an accounting entry that changes based on arbitrary decisions about dividends. Focus on the economics, not the accounting."

        "value": "This is one of the most important lessons in all of business and investing, and it illustrates perfectly why you can't manage a company by simply looking at accounting numbers. The answer is that accounting rules and economic reality often move in opposite directions, and you need to understand which one actually matters.\n\nHere's what happened with Scott Fetzer. When we bought the company, accounting rules required us to create something called \"purchase premium\" or goodwill on our books. Each year, we had to charge a portion of that premium against our earnings and reduce the carrying value on our balance sheet. So mechanically, the accounting value kept going down, down, down - from $142.6 million in premium in 1986 to just $54.2 million by 1994. Add that to the book value, and our total carrying value for Scott Fetzer was less than half what it was when we acquired it.\n\nBut look at what was happening in the real world. The business was earning about twice as much as when we bought it. Ralph Schey was running it beautifully, generating strong cash flows year after year, and building the intrinsic value of the enterprise. So we had this wonderful divergence: accounting value going down while intrinsic value was going up substantially.\n\nThis happens because accounting is based on historical costs and arbitrary amortization schedules, not on what a business is actually worth. The accounting rules say you must write down that purchase premium over time, regardless of whether the business is thriving or struggling. It's mechanical, not economic.\n\nNow, intrinsic value is something entirely different. It's the present value of all the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. When Scott Fetzer doubled its earnings under Ralph's management, it was generating far more cash that could be distributed to us as owners. That's real money we could use to buy other businesses, repurchase shares, or invest elsewhere. The intrinsic value was growing substantially.\n\nThis is why I keep emphasizing that managers and investors need to focus on intrinsic value, not accounting values. If you're running a business and you make decisions based solely on how they affect reported book value or reported earnings per share, you'll make terrible mistakes. You might avoid a wonderful acquisition because it creates goodwill that must be amortized, reducing reported earnings. Or you might make a foolish acquisition because it's immediately accretive to earnings per share, even though it destroys intrinsic value.\n\nThe Scott Fetzer example shows the gap can be enormous. The difference between its carrying value on our books and its true intrinsic value became huge over those years. An outside investor looking only at our balance sheet would have no idea how valuable that business had become.\n\nThis is also why we love managers like Ralph Schey. He understood that his job wasn't to manage accounting numbers. His job was to handle the basics well, allocate capital intelligently, and build the real economic value of the business. He did that superbly, and the result was that intrinsic value grew consistently even as we marked down the carrying value every single year. That's the kind of mismatch we're delighted to have."

It's like a student choosing a college major based solely on which classes meet latest in the day, rather than which education will be most valuable over a lifetime. You're optimizing for the wrong variable.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. When a manager considers an acquisition and asks only \"Will this increase our earnings per share next quarter or next year?\" they're ignoring the fundamental question: \"Are we paying more or less than this business is worth?\" You can have a transaction that's immediately accretive to earnings per share but destroys enormous value. And you can have one that's dilutive to near-term earnings but creates tremendous value.\n\nThink about the example I started to give in the text about the MBA student and the day laborer. If a 25-year-old MBA student merged his economic interests with a 25-year-old day laborer, the combined earnings per share might look great initially. The day laborer is earning money right now, so the \"merger\" would be immediately accretive. But the MBA student is investing in education that will pay off over decades. By focusing only on immediate earnings, you'd conclude this was a wonderful merger for the day laborer and a terrible one for the MBA student. In reality, the opposite is true when you consider the present value of lifetime earnings.\n\nThe same principle applies to corporate acquisitions. Suppose you're running a company trading at a high price-to-earnings ratio, and you acquire a company with a low P/E ratio. Mathematically, this will be accretive to your earnings per share. Your reported earnings will go up. But if you paid more than the acquisition was worth - if you paid more than the present value of its future cash flows - you've destroyed value for your shareholders, even though the earnings per share went up.\n\nThis happens all the time. Managers love to announce acquisitions that are \"immediately accretive to earnings.\" Investment bankers tout this feature. But it's often a sign that the acquirer overpaid. If you're buying a business at a high multiple of earnings, it's going to be dilutive. If you're buying at a low multiple, it's going to be accretive. But the multiple itself tells you nothing about whether you're paying a smart price relative to intrinsic value.\n\nWhat should managers do instead? They should ask: \"What is the intrinsic value of this business we're considering buying? What is our intrinsic value per share? If we pay cash, are we giving up more value than we're getting? If we're issuing shares, are we giving our shareholders' ownership in our valuable business for less valuable business?\" These are the questions that matter.\n\nAt Berkshire, we think about acquisitions in terms of intrinsic value per share. If we can increase the intrinsic value per share of Berkshire, we should do the deal, regardless of whether it's dilutive or accretive to near-term reported earnings. If it decreases intrinsic value per share, we shouldn't do it, even if it makes our earnings per share look better next quarter.\n\nThe same principle applies to share repurchases. The question isn't whether a buyback will increase earnings per share - of course it will, mechanically, if you're buying at any reasonable price. The question is whether you're buying at a price below intrinsic value. If you pay more than a business is worth, you've hurt the continuing shareholders, even if the earnings per share went up.\n\nThis is why understanding intrinsic value is absolutely vital for managers making capital allocation decisions. It's the difference between creating real wealth and just shuffling accounting numbers around while destroying value."

        "value": "Most acquisitions fail the acquiring shareholders because management focuses on the wrong metric entirely - they're mesmerized by near-term earnings accretion when they should be obsessing over intrinsic value per share. It's really that simple, though the consequences are profound.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When a company makes an acquisition, the critical question isn't whether earnings go up next quarter or next year. The question is whether each share of the acquiring company becomes more valuable. And here's where most deals go sideways: the acquirer typically pays more in intrinsic value than it receives. You're giving up a dollar of value to get eighty cents back, but because the accounting shows higher earnings, everyone congratulates themselves.\n\nThink about the MBA student example I used. If that student merged his economic future with a day laborer on a share-for-share basis, his reported \"earnings\" would jump immediately - he'd go from zero current income to sharing whatever the laborer makes. But would that be a smart deal? Of course not! The student's future earning power is worth far more than the immediate boost to current income. Yet this is precisely what companies do all the time in acquisitions. They sacrifice long-term intrinsic value for the cosmetic appeal of higher near-term earnings.\n\nNow, why does this happen so consistently? I've identified what I call a \"toxic triangle\" in most big deals. First, you've got the selling shareholders who almost always make out like bandits - they're getting a premium, often a hefty one, for their shares. Second, you've got the acquiring company's management, whose empire gets bigger, whose compensation typically rises, and whose status increases. Third, you've got the investment bankers and advisors who collect enormous fees regardless of whether the deal makes sense. Everyone in this triangle has a powerful incentive to get the deal done. The only party whose interests aren't represented at the table? The acquiring company's shareholders.\n\nAnd here's where human nature makes everything worse. As John Medlin said, if you keep giving up more value than you receive, you're running a chain letter in reverse. But CEOs often have what I call an abundance of animal spirits and ego - qualities that helped them reach the top. When you put someone with that psychological makeup in a room with advisors who profit from deals getting done, it's like encouraging a teenage boy to have a normal sex life. It's not a push he needs.\n\nThe biological bias is real. Asking your strategic planning staff or investment bankers whether you should do an acquisition is like asking your interior decorator if you need a $50,000 rug. You know what answer you're going to get. These advisors have every incentive to tell you that growth through acquisition is essential, that you'll fall behind competitors, that this is a unique opportunity. What they won't tell you is that you're about to transfer wealth from your shareholders to someone else's.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've walked away from countless deals that would have boosted our near-term earnings but would have reduced per-share intrinsic value. Our shareholders are billions of dollars richer because we followed Wayne Gretzky's advice: go to where the puck is going to be, not where it is. We're thinking about what each share will be worth in ten or twenty years, not what the earnings press release will say next quarter."

        "value": "Capital allocation is probably the most important job a CEO has, yet it's the one they're often least prepared for and most likely to botch. The impact is enormous because a really good business generates far more cash than it can productively use internally, and what management does with that excess cash compounds over time into vastly different outcomes.\n\nHere's the fundamental problem: when a company generates more cash than it needs for its operations, management faces a straightforward choice. They can return it to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, or they can try to reinvest it in the business, often through acquisitions. Returning cash is simple and honest - you're saying \"we can't find ways to invest your money that will beat what you could do with it yourself.\" But that's not what most CEOs want to say, even when it's true.\n\nInstead, what typically happens is the CEO turns to strategic planning staffs, consultants, or investment bankers and asks whether an acquisition might make sense. And here's where I use that interior decorator analogy - you're asking someone whose livelihood depends on you spending money whether you should spend money. The answer is preordained. These advisors will produce thick books full of projections and synergies and strategic rationale, all pointing toward doing a deal.\n\nThe deeper issue is psychological and biological. Many CEOs reached their positions precisely because they have an abundance of animal spirits and ego. These aren't entirely bad qualities - you need confidence and drive to run a large enterprise. But these same qualities make it very hard for a CEO to stand up at an annual meeting and say \"we're generating more cash than we can intelligently deploy, so we're giving it back to you.\" That feels like admitting defeat, like saying \"I'm not smart enough to find good uses for this money.\"\n\nThere's also an institutional bias toward action over inaction. Doing a big acquisition feels like leadership. You get your picture in the business press. You ring the bell at the stock exchange. You talk about strategic vision and transformative combinations. Buying back stock or paying dividends? That's boring. That doesn't feel like you're building an empire or leaving your mark.\n\nBut here's what really matters: over time, the skill with which managers allocate capital determines whether shareholders get rich or get fleeced. Let's say a company generates a billion dollars in excess cash each year for ten years. If management wastes that cash on overpriced acquisitions, they've destroyed ten billion dollars in value, plus all the compounding that money could have achieved. If instead they return it to shareholders or make disciplined acquisitions at sensible prices, that same ten billion compounds into something far larger.\n\nThe compounding effect of good versus bad capital allocation is staggering. It's not like making one mistake costs you a bit of money. It's that making the same mistake repeatedly - overpaying for acquisitions year after year - creates this reverse chain letter that John Medlin described. You're systematically transferring wealth away from your shareholders.\n\nWhat makes this especially pernicious is that bad capital allocation often looks good in the short term. The acquisition boosts earnings, the stock might pop on the announcement, and everyone celebrates. It's only years later, when the acquisition hasn't generated returns above the cost of capital, that the damage becomes clear. And by then, the CEO who did the deal has often moved on or retired, and there's no accountability.\n\nAt Berkshire, we've always believed that if we can't find intelligent ways to deploy capital - ways that will increase per-share intrinsic value - we should give it back to shareholders. That takes discipline and ego-control, but it's the only honest approach. The test isn't whether you can do a deal. The test is whether that deal will make your shareholders wealthier on a per-share basis than they would be if you'd simply returned the cash to them."

Notice what's not on that list - we don't acquire businesses because they're trendy, because they'll make us look good, or because everyone else is doing deals.\n\nThe pathology my CEO friend described - \"all the other kids have one\" - is more common than you'd think, and it stems from some very human psychological weaknesses. CEOs are competitive people by nature. They read about other executives making big acquisitions, they see the headlines, they attend conferences where deal-making is celebrated, and there's this enormous pressure to do something. Sitting on your hands and waiting for the right opportunity doesn't generate press releases or investment banking fees. It doesn't give you something exciting to talk about at industry gatherings.\n\nThere's also what I call institutional imperative at work here. Large companies have corporate development departments whose job is to find acquisitions. Investment banks are constantly pitching deals because that's how they make money. The CEO is surrounded by people whose careers depend on transactions happening. When everyone around you is pushing for action, it takes real fortitude to say no.\n\nThe compensation structure at most companies makes this worse. If a CEO's options are tied to the company's size or short-term stock price movements, doing a big acquisition - even a mediocre one - might trigger a bonus. The CEO gets paid whether the deal works out or not. By the time the acquisition proves to be a mistake, the CEO has often moved on or the failure gets buried in restructuring charges.\n\nAt Berkshire, we try to be patient. Charlie and I know that we'll be judged over the long term on whether we've built per-share intrinsic value. We can't hide behind accounting gimmicks or blame our predecessors. This focuses the mind wonderfully. When we look at an acquisition, we're asking whether it will make our shareholders wealthier per share ten or twenty years from now, not whether it will generate excitement next quarter.\n\nThe \"understanding the business\" criterion is crucial and often overlooked. Wall Street loves to talk about synergies and strategic rationale, but if you don't truly understand how a business makes money and what could go wrong, you're just gambling. We've passed on countless deals in industries we don't understand, even when the price looked attractive on paper.\n\nThe sustainable economics part matters because a business that's earning good returns today due to temporary factors or luck isn't worth much. We want businesses with durable competitive advantages - what we call moats - that can maintain attractive returns on capital for decades.\n\nFinally, management quality is non-negotiable. We're buying businesses to keep, not to fix. If we don't trust and admire the people running the operation, we won't do the deal at any price. Life's too short to work with people you don't like, and besides, we're not smart enough to turn around broken management cultures."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Most corporate compensation plans are fundamentally dishonest about alignment, and I think it's important to call this out directly. True partnership means you share in both the gains and the losses. If I'm your partner in a business and we lose money, I don't get to say \"well, I still want my share of profits we didn't earn.\" But that's exactly how most executive compensation works - it's heads I win, tails you lose.\n\nLet me walk you through what real alignment looks like using Ralph Schey at Scott Fetzer as an example. First, we compensate Ralph based solely on Scott Fetzer's results, not Berkshire's overall performance. This might seem obvious, but it's actually quite different from most companies. If Ralph were compensated based on Berkshire's stock price or overall earnings, he'd be getting rewarded or punished for things completely outside his control. Charlie and I might make a terrible acquisition in insurance while Ralph is doing brilliant work at Scott Fetzer, and under a typical stock option plan, Ralph would suffer. That makes no sense.\n\nThe capital charge system is where it gets really interesting and where true symmetry comes in. When Ralph wants to deploy additional capital in his business, we charge him a high rate on that capital in calculating his bonus. Let's say he wants to build a new facility or expand into a new product line. If the returns on that incremental investment exceed our hurdle rate, Ralph's bonus goes up. He's rewarded for smart capital allocation. But here's the crucial part - if that investment generates sub-standard returns, Ralph's bonus goes down. The shortfall costs him personally, not just Berkshire.\n\nThis creates the right incentives. Ralph thinks very carefully about whether he really needs that new capital or whether he's just empire building. And here's what happens in practice: Ralph sends us any cash he can't deploy at attractive returns. He's not trying to hoard capital to make his operation bigger or to have more resources under his control. He's trying to maximize his bonus, and the way to do that is to be honest about what capital he can actually use productively.\n\nThe symmetry works the other way too. We credit Ralph at an equally high rate when he releases capital. If he figures out how to run the business with less inventory or gets paid faster by customers, freeing up working capital, he gets credited for that in his bonus calculation. This is real partnership - he benefits from being capital-efficient, not just from growing revenues or assets.\n\nCompare this to typical stock option plans. Options have no downside. If the stock goes up for any reason - maybe the whole market rises, maybe the company gets lucky, maybe other divisions perform well - the executive makes a fortune. If the stock goes down, the options expire worthless but the executive hasn't lost anything he actually had. Often companies just re-price the options or grant new ones. Where's the partnership in that?\n\nThe fashionable term is \"pay for performance,\" but most plans are really \"pay for showing up, with a lottery ticket attached.\" Executives get large salaries and benefits regardless of results, then get options or bonuses that only pay off on the upside. Shareholders, meanwhile, are true partners - when the business does poorly, the value of their investment declines.\n\nOur approach at Berkshire isn't complicated, but it requires honesty about what alignment really means. It means charging for capital because capital isn't free. It means making sure managers feel the pain of poor decisions, not just the glory of good ones. It means tying compensation to things people actually control. When you structure things this way, you get managers who think like owners because they truly are partners in both directions."

A true alignment means you're in it together through thick and thin, not just collecting when things go well while being insulated when they don't.\n\nLet me walk you through the mathematics of why standard options are so flawed. When a company retains earnings rather than paying them out as dividends, those retained earnings belong to the shareholders. They're building value inside the company that should benefit the owners. But here's the rub: stock option plans almost never adjust the strike price upward to account for this accumulation of retained earnings. So a manager holding a ten-year option on a company that pays low dividends gets to benefit from all that retained capital without having done anything to earn it. The company's stock price might rise simply because earnings are being plowed back into the business year after year, compounding away. The manager could literally be doing a mediocre job – just treading water, as I said – and still make a fortune when those options vest.\n\nThink about the perverse incentives this creates. If I'm a manager with a boatload of options, I'm actually better off if the company pays tiny dividends or none at all. Every dollar retained in the business potentially inflates the stock price and increases my option value, even though that dollar already belonged to the shareholders. I've never seen a proxy statement that honestly explains this conflict of interest to shareholders who are being asked to approve these plans. It's a glaring omission, but not a surprising one.\n\nThe \"heads I win, tails you lose\" aspect comes from the asymmetry built into options. If the stock goes up for any reason – good management, a bull market, retained earnings, industry tailwinds, pure luck – the option holder profits handsomely. But if the stock goes down or just muddles along, the option expires worthless and the manager loses nothing except an opportunity. The shareholders, meanwhile, have lost real wealth. They were actual owners who suffered actual losses. The manager was just holding a free lottery ticket.\n\nThis is why our arrangement with Ralph Schey at Scott Fetzer was so different and so simple. We worked it out in five minutes because we focused on what made rational sense for both parties. We didn't need compensation consultants to complicate things – and believe me, consultants have every incentive to find complexity and problems that require their ongoing involvement and justify their fees. Ralph's compensation was tied directly to his actual accomplishments in managing his business, not to factors beyond his control or to the mere passage of time while earnings accumulated.\n\nThe broader point is that compensation should reward managers for what they actually contribute, not for showing up while the company's retained capital does the heavy lifting. When you get compensation wrong at the top, you encourage similar irrationality throughout the organization. Subsidiaries start imitating the parent company's confused thinking, and pretty soon you've got an entire corporate culture that's lost sight of what really matters."

But we've deliberately chosen not to structure things that way, and the reasoning is straightforward.\n\nWe've designed both the company and our specific roles so that we spend our days doing exactly what we love with people we genuinely enjoy. Think about what that means in practical terms. I come to work and read, think about businesses, make decisions about capital allocation, and write letters to shareholders explaining our thinking. These aren't chores I'm forcing myself through – they're activities I'd pursue even if I weren't being paid. Charlie and I have structured Berkshire so we can avoid the tedious, bureaucratic nonsense that consumes so much time at typical corporations. We don't spend our days in endless meetings, dealing with investment bankers pitching deals we don't want, managing layers of corporate staff, or engaging in the political maneuvering that characterizes many large organizations.\n\nBeyond the joy of the work itself, we receive what I call an \"abundant array of material and psychic perks\" that come with running a large, successful enterprise. We have interesting problems to solve, we're respected in the business community, we have access to extraordinary people and opportunities, and we have the satisfaction of building something meaningful. The psychic income alone is enormous. When you factor in that we're already wealthy beyond any possible need, the idea of piling on additional compensation becomes somewhat absurd.\n\nThis connects to a larger principle about human motivation that I think many boards and compensation consultants completely miss. People aren't simple machines that only respond to financial incentives. When you've already achieved financial security, what drives you is the intrinsic satisfaction of the work, the relationships you build, the respect you earn, and the legacy you create. Charlie and I don't need to be bribed with stock options or bonuses to show up and do our best. We're doing our best because we love what we do and we're working for partners – our shareholders – whom we respect and don't want to disappoint.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan quote I included – about hard work never killing anyone but why take the chance – was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it makes a serious point. Our jobs aren't \"hard\" in the sense of being unpleasant or burdensome. We've made them cushy by design. We've eliminated the parts we'd find tedious and kept the parts we find fascinating. When you can structure your work life that way, and you're already financially comfortable, asking shareholders to pay you vast sums becomes unseemly.\n\nThis philosophy also sends an important message throughout Berkshire. When the people at the top aren't grabbing every dollar they can justify, it sets a tone of rationality and restraint. Our subsidiary managers see that we're not enriching ourselves at shareholder expense, and it reinforces the culture of treating Berkshire's money as if it were our own – because it is. We're major shareholders ourselves, so we think like owners, not like hired hands trying to maximize our take before moving on to the next opportunity.\n\nThe practical lesson here is that compensation should reflect genuine need and genuine contribution, not just what you can extract from a compliant board. When executives are already wealthy and genuinely enjoy their work, piling on excessive compensation isn't just wasteful – it's corrosive to the culture and insulting to shareholders."

Our super-cat business insures against truly catastrophic events—the kind of mega-disasters that, thankfully, don't occur very often. In 1994, we had only one significant loss from the California earthquake in January, and the business was highly profitable. But here's the critical point: the infrequency of major catastrophes means we're going to look like geniuses most years. We'll collect premiums and pay out relatively little. Then, every so often, we're going to get walloped with an enormous loss when a true mega-catastrophe strikes.\n\nThis creates a dangerous optical illusion. If you judge our super-cat business by looking at any single year, or even a string of good years, you'll dramatically overestimate its true economic value. It's like watching a gambler win hand after hand at a casino and concluding he's found a foolproof system, when in reality the house edge is just waiting to assert itself over time. The difference, of course, is that we've structured our business so the odds favor us, not against us—but only when measured over many, many years.\n\nThis is why I specifically said that \"the attractiveness of our super-cat business will take many years to measure.\" We need to see this business through multiple catastrophe cycles before we can truly judge whether Ajit Jain's underwriting is as brilliant as we think it is, and whether our pricing is adequate for the risks we're assuming. I described 1994 as \"close to a best-case\" scenario precisely because I want shareholders to understand that this level of profitability is not the norm they should expect.\n\nThe broader principle here applies to evaluating any business with lumpy, infrequent outcomes. You cannot judge such businesses by short-term results, no matter how impressive or disappointing those results might be. You need to think probabilistically and over long time horizons. This requires patience and intellectual discipline that most investors simply don't have.\n\nWhat I'm really doing is managing expectations and teaching shareholders to think correctly about probability and risk. When the inevitable mega-catastrophe eventually hits and we report a huge loss in our super-cat business, I don't want shareholders to panic and think something has gone wrong. That loss will simply be the other side of the coin we've been describing all along. The true test of our underwriting will be whether, over decades, the premiums we collect exceed the losses we pay plus a reasonable return on the capital we deploy. That's the only rational way to evaluate this business, and I want our shareholders to understand that from the beginning."

Let me explain exactly how this works, because it illustrates a broader principle about how certain businesses operate.\n\nThink about what an insurance company is doing when it buys super-cat reinsurance from us. They're protecting themselves against a catastrophic loss—maybe a $50 billion windstorm hitting Long Island or a massive California earthquake. Now here's the paradox: the very event that triggers their need to collect on the policy is the same event that might bankrupt their reinsurer. If a mega-catastrophe occurs and multiple reinsurers can't pay their claims, the primary insurer's \"protection\" evaporates exactly when they need it most. It's like buying a parachute that only works on sunny days.\n\nThis is where Berkshire's financial strength becomes decisive. When a primary insurer looks at us, they see a company with such enormous capital resources that we'll absolutely, positively be able to pay even after an unthinkable catastrophe. That certainty is worth a great deal. It means prudent insurers will prefer to buy from us even if our prices are somewhat higher than less-capitalized competitors, because they know our promise is ironclad. We're not just selling insurance coverage; we're selling certainty.\n\nThe second advantage of our capital strength is even more straightforward but equally powerful: we can write policies in amounts that nobody else can consider. When someone needed $400 million of California earthquake coverage in 1994, they couldn't piece that together from multiple smaller reinsurers—they needed one company that could write the entire policy immediately. We could do it; virtually nobody else could. This isn't just a competitive advantage; it's a monopoly position for certain types of very large risks.\n\nNow, here's why this matters so much and why it's so hard to replicate: building the kind of financial strength Berkshire has takes decades of retained earnings and disciplined capital allocation. A competitor can't just decide to match us tomorrow. They'd need tens of billions of dollars in capital, and even if they raised it, they wouldn't have our track record and reputation for absolute reliability. Meanwhile, we're getting stronger every year as we retain more earnings.\n\nThis creates what I call a moat around our business. The combination of our capital strength and Ajit Jain's underwriting expertise means we can write business that others simply cannot, and we can do so with customers who value certainty over the lowest possible price. That's a beautiful business position to be in.\n\nThe broader lesson here is that in certain businesses, financial strength isn't just about surviving tough times—it's an offensive weapon that allows you to do things competitors cannot do and charge premium prices for capabilities that customers desperately need. This is particularly true in businesses where counterparty risk matters enormously. When your promise to pay might not be tested for years, but when it is tested the amounts are enormous, then your financial strength becomes your primary product. We're not really selling insurance policies; we're selling our balance sheet, and fortunately, we've got the best balance sheet in the business."

        "value": "This is one of the most liberating concepts in investing, and I'm glad you asked about it because too many people get this exactly backwards. In Olympic diving, you get higher scores for attempting difficult dives - a triple somersault with a twist earns more points than a simple dive, even if both are executed perfectly. But in investing, you get no extra points whatsoever for degree of difficulty. A simple idea that makes you money is worth exactly the same as a complex idea that makes you the same amount.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. Many investors, particularly those coming out of business schools or working at investment firms, feel they need to demonstrate their intellectual horsepower by analyzing incredibly complex situations. They'll dive into companies with multiple moving parts, complicated financial structures, businesses in rapid transition, or industries where technological change makes the future murky. They seem to think that if an investment thesis can't fill fifty pages and require advanced mathematics, it's somehow beneath them.\n\nThis is completely wrong-headed. What we try to do at Berkshire is look for businesses where the key investment factors are both easy to understand and enduring. Take Coca-Cola, which you can see in our portfolio. The investment thesis is remarkably simple: People around the world like to drink Coke, they'll continue to like drinking Coke, the brand is powerful, the distribution system is entrenched, and the economics of the concentrate business are excellent. You can explain this in a paragraph or two. There's nothing intellectually impressive about this analysis, but that doesn't make it less valuable.\n\nNow compare that to trying to figure out which technology company will win in some new, emerging field where the landscape changes every few years. You might write a brilliant hundred-page analysis, but you're still guessing about factors that are inherently unknowable. You're working much harder and taking on much more risk, but you get no extra credit if you happen to be right.\n\nThe beauty of focusing on simple, understandable businesses is that you can actually know what you're doing. When we bought See's Candies back in 1972, the analysis was straightforward: People have been giving boxed chocolates as gifts for generations, See's has a wonderful reputation in the West, the brand commands pricing power, and the capital requirements are modest. These facts were easy to verify and likely to endure. We didn't need to be geniuses to understand See's - we just needed to be rational.\n\nThis approach also helps you avoid mistakes. If you can't explain why you're buying something in simple terms, you probably don't understand it well enough to own it. Complexity creates more places for your analysis to go wrong. Every additional assumption you layer in is another opportunity for error.\n\nThe scorecard that matters is simply whether you make good returns on your capital over time. Nobody asks whether you did it by analyzing simple businesses or complex ones. So why not stick with what you can understand? Find businesses with enduring competitive advantages, wait until they're available at sensible prices, and don't worry about impressing anyone with the sophistication of your analysis. That's how we've approached it for decades, and it's worked out just fine."

        "value": "This gets at a fundamental distinction that separates successful long-term investors from everyone else. When we make an investment decision, we're making an informed judgment about a specific business - its competitive position, its management, its economics, and what it's worth. But when we try to time the market, we're making an uninformed guess about things that are inherently unpredictable. Why would you ever scrap an informed decision because of an uninformed guess?\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When we look at a business like Gillette or American Express, we can analyze factors that are reasonably predictable over the long term. Will men continue shaving? Will businesses and consumers need payment services? What kind of returns on capital can these franchises generate? These questions have answers grounded in durable competitive advantages and long-term business fundamentals. We can be right or wrong, but we're working with analyzable information.\n\nNow contrast that with trying to predict what the stock market will do next month or next year, or whether the economy will be in recession in six months. Nobody can do this consistently - not us, not economists, not market strategists, nobody. The economy and the stock market are complex systems influenced by countless variables, many of them psychological. They're inherently unpredictable in the short term.\n\nHere's what happens when you let market timing drive your decisions: You find a wonderful business at a fair price, but you think, \"Well, maybe the market will go down, so I'll wait.\" Then one of two things happens. Either the market does go down but the stock you wanted doesn't go down with it, or the market goes up and you've missed your opportunity entirely. Meanwhile, if you'd simply bought the business at a fair price when you found it, you'd be earning returns on your capital the whole time you were sitting on the sidelines waiting.\n\nLook at the businesses we've bought over the years that I mentioned - National Indemnity in 1967, See's in 1972, Buffalo News in 1977, Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, Scott Fetzer in 1986. We bought them in those specific years for one simple reason: those were the years they became available at acceptable prices. We didn't check whether it was a good time to buy stocks generally. We didn't consult economic forecasts. We didn't worry about whether the market was high or low. We looked at each business individually and asked whether the price made sense relative to what we were getting.\n\nThis approach requires a certain mindset. You have to think of yourself as buying a piece of a business, not buying a stock that you hope will go up. When you buy a private business - say you're buying the local hardware store - you don't call the broker the next day to get a quote. You evaluate the business, you pay a fair price, and then you focus on how the business performs over the years. That's exactly how we think about marketable securities.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it's actually less stressful and more profitable. You're not constantly second-guessing yourself based on economic news or market movements. You're not trying to be smarter than everyone else about unknowable short-term factors. You're simply waiting for good businesses to become available at sensible prices, and then you're buying them and holding them.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean price doesn't matter - it matters enormously. That's why I said we try to \"price\" purchases. We won't pay any price for even the best business. But once we've determined that a price is sensible relative to the long-term value of the business, we don't let guesses about market timing interfere with that informed judgment. That discipline has served us well for decades."

We're buying fractional ownership in actual businesses, and that changes everything about how you should think about investing. If this seems obvious, well, it should be – but you'd be amazed how many people forget it the moment they start watching stock prices bounce around on a screen.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic here. When we bought Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, we didn't call up an economist to ask whether the Fed was going to raise rates next quarter. We didn't check what the Dow Jones Industrial Average was doing. We looked at Mrs. B's business – how she ran it, what kind of competitive advantages it had, whether it would be worth more in ten or twenty years. We asked ourselves: Is this a good business? Are we paying a sensible price? Will it generate good returns on our capital over time? Those were the only questions that mattered.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. When you buy a small piece of a business in the stock market – say, shares of Coca-Cola – you're doing exactly the same thing economically. You own a slice of that business. The only real difference is that you can't buy the whole thing, and there's a stock price quoted to you every day. But the underlying reality is identical: you're a business owner, and your returns will ultimately come from what that business accomplishes.\n\nSo why would you change your entire analytical framework just because you're buying a smaller piece? It makes no sense. If business analysis is the right approach for buying 100% of See's Candies, then it's the right approach for buying 5% of Coca-Cola through the stock market. The economic substance is the same.\n\nThis is why we spend our time studying businesses – their competitive positions, their management, their economics – rather than trying to predict what the market will do next Tuesday. I can't tell you where the Dow will be next year, and frankly, I don't care. But I can tell you that people will still be drinking Coca-Cola, and that's what matters for our investment.\n\nThe beauty of thinking this way is that it keeps you grounded in reality. Businesses operate in the real world. They make products, serve customers, generate cash flows. These are tangible things you can analyze and understand. The stock market, on the other hand, is driven by emotions, by fear and greed, by people reacting to headlines. If you let the market's mood swings dictate your investment approach, you're building your financial future on sand.\n\nWhen we enlarged our holdings in Coca-Cola and American Express, we weren't making a bet on the stock market. We were increasing our ownership in businesses we understood and admired, at prices that made sense. We were doing exactly what we'd do if we could buy more of See's – except See's isn't for sale because we already own all of it. The stock market simply gave us the opportunity to do something we couldn't do with our wholly-owned businesses: buy more of something wonderful at a reasonable price."

When you've observed something for decades, you develop an understanding that simply can't be replicated by reading a few quarterly reports or analyst presentations. You see how the business works through different economic cycles, under different managements, facing different competitive threats. That kind of knowledge is pure gold.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. When American Express got hit by the salad-oil scandal in the mid-1960s, the stock got hammered. Most investors saw a company in crisis and ran for the exits. But I'd been watching American Express for years. I'd owned IDS stock back in 1953. I understood what made the franchise valuable – and critically, I could see that the salad-oil scandal, while embarrassing and costly, hadn't damaged the fundamental franchise. People still trusted the American Express card. Travelers still wanted American Express travelers checks. The core business was intact.\n\nThat insight didn't come from being smarter than other investors. It came from having watched the business for over a decade. I knew what mattered and what didn't. When everyone else was panicking, I could see that the baby hadn't been thrown out with the bathwater – the baby was still there, healthy as ever, just temporarily unloved. So we put 40% of the partnership's capital into it. That's the kind of conviction you can only have when you really know a business.\n\nThe same principle applied with Coca-Cola, though it took me even longer to fully appreciate what I was seeing. I bought six-packs for 25 cents and sold individual bottles for 5 cents back in the 1930s. I watched people buy that product year after year, decade after decade. I saw the brand power firsthand. But it took me fifty years to fully grasp where the real value was – in the syrup, in the concentrate, in the capital-light business model that generated extraordinary returns. When I finally got it, we made it one of our largest investments.\n\nThis teaches us something crucial about developing as an investor: you need to be a perpetual student of business. Start observing businesses early – how they work, what makes customers loyal, what gives one company an advantage over another. Don't wait until you have a million dollars to invest before you start learning. I was learning about Coca-Cola's business model when I was a kid, even though I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nThe Washington Post example is similar. I delivered that paper in the 1940s. I saw how essential it was to people's daily lives in Washington. Decades later, when the company went public and then hit a rough patch, I understood the franchise value because I'd observed it for thirty years. That's a different kind of knowledge than you get from a spreadsheet.\n\nHere's the practical lesson: build your circle of competence over time through direct observation and experience. Pay attention to the businesses you interact with. Which ones have staying power? Which ones do customers really love? Which ones have pricing power? These observations accumulate and compound, just like investment returns. When opportunity knocks – and it will, because good businesses occasionally become available at good prices – you'll recognize it because you've been preparing for decades.\n\nThe pattern isn't about investing in things from your past. It's about investing in things you've had time to truly understand. Sometimes that takes fifty years. But when you finally see the opportunity clearly, you can act with conviction."

The Cap Cities mistake was one of opportunity cost—I sold a wonderful business run by terrific people at a price that turned out to be far too low. The USAir mistake was far more serious: I bought into a business with structural problems that I failed to analyze properly. If I had to rank investment sins, buying bad businesses is considerably worse than selling good ones too early.\n\nLet me explain why. When you sell a great business like Cap Cities prematurely, you're giving up future gains, and that hurts. We left $222.5 million on the table, which is real money by anyone's standards. But here's the key point: we didn't lose our original capital. We made money; we just didn't make as much as we should have. The business itself was sound, the management was excellent, and our initial analysis was correct. My only error was in timing and in failing to appreciate just how valuable the franchise would become. This is what I'd call a \"high-class problem\"—the mistake of being too conservative with a winner.\n\nThe USAir investment represents something far more troubling: a failure of analysis at the most basic level. I put $358 million into a business whose fundamental economics were deteriorating, and I should have seen it coming. This wasn't a case where circumstances changed unexpectedly. The problems were baked into the cake—high costs that were extremely difficult to lower, an industry moving from regulation to competition, and the inexorable expansion of low-cost carriers. I called it an \"unforced error,\" and that's exactly right. Nobody made me do it. I simply failed to think through the implications of deregulation on a high-cost carrier.\n\nWhat made the USAir mistake particularly egregious was that the basic principle at work should have been obvious to me: in an unregulated commodity business, you must have competitive costs or you're doomed. Airlines sell an undifferentiated product—a seat from point A to point B. When regulation protected the industry, high-cost carriers could pass along their expenses through high fares. But once low-cost competitors could expand their capacity, the fundamental economics asserted themselves. You can delay the reckoning with capital infusions, as we did, but you can't escape the underlying reality.\n\nThe hierarchy here is clear: it's far better to buy a wonderful company and sell it too soon than to buy a mediocre or poor business at any price. With Cap Cities, I at least demonstrated the ability to identify quality. With USAir, I failed at the most fundamental task of investment analysis—understanding the basic economics of the business. Perhaps I was seduced by the fact that we were buying a senior security, or perhaps it was hubris. Whatever the cause, it represented sloppy thinking, and in investing, sloppy thinking eventually gets punished. The lesson is simple: focus your energy on finding great businesses and then have the sense to hold onto them. Mistakes of omission—not buying enough of something good—are inevitable. But mistakes of commission—buying something fundamentally flawed—are far more damaging and far more avoidable."

But here's the critical distinction—familiarity alone isn't enough. You need to combine that familiarity with rigorous analysis of the fundamental economics. My mistakes with Cap Cities and USAir show what happens when you have one without the other.\n\nWith American Express, I had years of observing how the company worked, how customers valued its products, and how it navigated challenges. This wasn't casual observation—it was the kind of deep familiarity that comes from paying attention over time. When you watch a business through multiple cycles, you start to understand what's durable and what's temporary, what's fundamental to the franchise and what's just noise. That long-term perspective is invaluable because it helps you distinguish between a company facing a temporary setback and one facing a permanent impairment.\n\nNow, let's look at my Cap Cities mistake through this lens. I actually had excellent familiarity with this business. I'd owned it before, sold it foolishly in 1978-80 at $4.30 per share, then had the good sense to buy it back at $17.25 in 1986. I knew the management—Tom Murphy and Dan Burke were among the best operators in American business. I understood the economics of their television stations and publishing properties. So what went wrong when I sold at $63? I had the familiarity, but I failed to fully appreciate the durability of the competitive advantages and the quality of the management. I understood the business, but I didn't trust my understanding enough to simply sit tight and let a great business compound.\n\nThe USAir situation reveals a different and more serious problem: I had neither sufficient familiarity nor proper analysis. I should have spent more time understanding the airline industry's economics, particularly in a deregulated environment. Had I observed the industry carefully over a longer period, I would have seen the pattern: as low-cost carriers gradually expanded capacity, they forced pricing discipline on the entire industry. The high-cost carriers couldn't maintain their fare structures, but they also couldn't quickly reduce their embedded costs. This wasn't a subtle dynamic—it was playing out in real-time. My lack of deep familiarity with the industry meant I missed what should have been obvious.\n\nHere's what I've learned from these experiences: familiarity gives you pattern recognition, but it must be combined with clear-eyed analysis of competitive dynamics and basic economics. With American Express, I had both—years of observation plus an understanding of why the franchise was valuable. With Cap Cities, I had the familiarity and understanding but lacked the conviction to act on it properly. With USAir, I had neither adequate familiarity nor sound analysis, and I compounded the error by perhaps being overconfident because we were buying preferred stock rather than common equity.\n\nThe practical lesson is this: stay within your circle of competence, which means areas where you have both familiarity and analytical understanding. Take the time to watch businesses operate over extended periods. See how they handle adversity. Understand their products as a customer would. But don't mistake casual familiarity for deep understanding, and don't let familiarity substitute for rigorous analysis of the fundamental economics. When you find a business you truly understand, run by people you trust, selling at a reasonable price, the right move is usually to buy it and then exercise what I call \"benign neglect\"—just let it compound. My Cap Cities sale shows that even when you get the analysis right, you can still mess things up by being too active. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is simply nothing at all."

What I'm saying is simple: once you've made a mistake and lost money, your only job is to make the best decision going forward with the facts as they exist today. The past is irrelevant except as a learning tool.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. When we invested in USAir, we paid $358 million. By the end of 1994, we wrote it down to $89.5 million. Now, the natural human impulse—and I've felt it myself many times—is to think, \"Well, I need to hold onto this investment until it gets back to $358 million so I can break even.\" But that's completely irrational thinking. The question isn't \"How do I get back to even on USAir?\" The question is \"If I had $89.5 million in cash today, would USAir preferred stock be the best place to put it?\"\n\nYou see, money doesn't have memory. Those dollars don't know they came from a USAir investment that went bad. They don't care about your cost basis or your ego or your desire to prove you weren't wrong. The only thing that matters is: what's the best use of capital right now? Maybe USAir will recover, maybe it won't. But if there's a better opportunity elsewhere—and there almost always is when you've made a bad investment—you should take it.\n\nThis ties directly to what we call \"opportunity cost,\" which is one of the most important concepts in business and investing. Every dollar you have tied up in a mediocre or poor investment is a dollar you can't put into a good one. If I can earn 15% annually in Business A but I'm stubbornly holding onto Business B hoping it recovers just so I can break even, I'm losing that 15% every single year. That's real money walking out the door.\n\nThe psychological trap here is what I'd call the \"break-even syndrome.\" People hate to realize losses because it means admitting they were wrong. There's something final about selling at a loss—it makes the mistake real and permanent. But here's the truth: the mistake was already real and permanent the moment the investment declined in value. Holding onto it doesn't change that; it just prevents you from moving forward.\n\nIn the USAir situation, we had to face facts. Seth Schofield was working hard, but the airline industry had become brutally competitive. Some carriers were getting labor concessions, others were emerging from bankruptcy with cleaned-up balance sheets—what Herb Kelleher aptly called a \"health spa.\" USAir was stuck with above-market costs, and employees receiving above-market salaries naturally resisted cuts as long as their paychecks cleared. These were the facts on the ground.\n\nSo we took our writedown and moved on. We didn't compound the error by throwing good money after bad or by holding onto a poor investment just because of what we'd paid for it. The past was past. Our job was to deploy capital where it would earn the best returns going forward, and that meant being brutally honest about USAir's prospects and not letting our egos get in the way of good decision-making."

Period. There's no way around it, no matter how much capital you inject or how long you delay the reckoning.\n\nLet me break down why commodity businesses are so difficult. When you're selling a product or service that customers view as essentially interchangeable—and airline seats are the definition of a commodity—you can't charge a premium price. A seat from New York to Chicago on USAir is fundamentally the same as a seat on United or American or Southwest. Sure, there might be minor differences in service or schedule, but mostly customers buy on price and convenience. This means the low-cost producer has an enormous, almost insurmountable advantage.\n\nNow, I knew this principle intellectually. Charlie and I had seen it play out in textiles at Berkshire, in steel, in many industries. But somehow I convinced myself that USAir would be different, or that the industry dynamics would change, or that management could overcome the cost disadvantage. I was wrong, and it was a costly lesson in the danger of making exceptions to sound principles.\n\nWhat made the airline industry particularly brutal was that it combined commodity economics with huge fixed costs and powerful unions. You can't just shut down planes when demand is soft—you've got massive capital tied up in aircraft, gates, and infrastructure. And when your competitors are getting labor concessions or emerging from bankruptcy with restructured costs, you're facing what I mentioned as a \"moving target.\" Seth Schofield at USAir was working diligently to cut costs, but while he was doing that, other carriers were cutting even more or getting fresh starts through bankruptcy.\n\nHerb Kelleher's comment that bankruptcy court had become a \"health spa\" for airlines was darkly humorous but absolutely accurate. Companies could shed their legacy costs, renegotiate contracts, and emerge lean and competitive. Meanwhile, airlines like USAir that stayed out of bankruptcy were stuck with above-market labor contracts. And here's the thing about those contracts: employees earning above-market wages will naturally resist cuts as long as their paychecks keep clearing. Why wouldn't they? From their perspective, they have a contract and they're just asking for what they're owed.\n\nSo why did I miss something that should have been obvious? Partly it was hope over experience. Partly it was thinking I could see something others couldn't. But mostly it was a failure to rigorously apply a principle I already knew. In unregulated commodity businesses, cost structure is destiny. You can delay the day of reckoning with capital infusions—which is exactly what we did—but you can't avoid it forever. The fundamental economics will prevail.\n\nThe contrast with the managers I praised at the end of that section—Dan Burke at Cap Cities/ABC and Carl Reichardt at Wells Fargo—is instructive. They faced tough industry conditions too, but they ran businesses with better fundamental economics. They had competitive advantages beyond just cost, whether through content ownership, distribution networks, or customer relationships. And they managed costs relentlessly, so when their industries got tough, their companies emerged stronger.\n\nThe lesson for investors is this: be very, very careful with commodity businesses. If you're going to invest in one, the company better be the low-cost producer, and that advantage better be sustainable. Otherwise, you're just hoping, and hope is not an investment strategy."
