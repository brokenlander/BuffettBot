        "value": "Both approaches work beautifully, but they're as different as night and day in execution, and that's what makes this partnership with Jorge Paulo and his team so interesting to me. Let me walk you through why these different paths both lead to the same destination of creating shareholder value.\n\nJorge Paulo, Alex, and Bernardo are surgical in their approach. They look at a company and immediately see where fat has accumulated - unnecessary layers of management, redundant positions, inefficient processes that nobody questioned because \"that's how we've always done it.\" Then they move with incredible speed and precision to cut out that fat. It's not pleasant work, but it's necessary work, and they're exceptionally good at it. The productivity gains they achieve are real and substantial. They're essentially taking a business that's producing, say, 70 units of output per employee and getting it to 100 units. That 30% improvement flows straight to the bottom line and benefits the overall economy.\n\nNow, our approach at Berkshire is fundamentally different, though the end goal is the same. We're looking for businesses that never got fat in the first place. When we bought Precision Castparts, we weren't buying it to slash costs - we were buying it because Mark Donegan and his team had already built a culture of efficiency over decades. The cost-consciousness was baked into the DNA of the organization. These are businesses where the managers think like owners because, in many cases, they were owners before we bought them.\n\nHere's the key distinction: Jorge Paulo's method requires intensive post-acquisition work. You've got to go in, analyze every department, make tough decisions about people and processes, and implement changes rapidly. It's transformational work. Our method is about finding businesses that don't need transformation. We're paying up for quality, for cultures that are already optimized, and then our job is simply to not screw it up. We create an environment where great managers can keep doing what they do best without interference from headquarters.\n\nThink about it from a manager's perspective. If you're running a tight ship, constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency, and genuinely love your business, do you want new owners coming in and turning everything upside down? Probably not. You want owners who appreciate what you've built and will let you keep building it. That's what we offer, and it's why managers of wonderful businesses often prefer selling to Berkshire.\n\nBoth approaches address the same fundamental economic reality: productivity is everything. As I mentioned, without productivity gains - more output per working hour - an economy stagnates. Jorge Paulo creates productivity gains through restructuring. We create them by letting already-productive managers operate in an ideal environment and by making bolt-on acquisitions that leverage their expertise.\n\nThe beauty is that both methods work, and they work in different situations. Some businesses need the 3G treatment. Others need the Berkshire treatment. Understanding which approach fits which situation is crucial, and that's why I'm comfortable being partners with Jorge Paulo while running Berkshire completely differently. We respect what each other does, even though we'd never swap playbooks."

        "value": "Bolt-on acquisitions are one of the most beautiful aspects of our business model, and I'm glad you asked about this because it's something we'll be doing dozens of times in the years ahead. Let me explain why these deals are so attractive and how they compound our advantages over time.\n\nWhen we make a large standalone acquisition - say, buying Precision Castparts for $37 billion - we're acquiring an entire business with its own management team, its own culture, its own systems. That's wonderful when we find the right business with the right people, but there's a limit to how many of these we can do. I can't personally oversee 100 different CEOs, and I don't want to. We've got this incredibly flat structure at Berkshire where our operating managers report directly to me or Charlie, and that works because we have a manageable number of these relationships.\n\nBut bolt-on acquisitions work entirely differently, and this is where the magic happens. Let's say one of our existing businesses - maybe a company in our manufacturing group - identifies a smaller competitor or a complementary business in their industry. They know that industry cold. They know the customers, the suppliers, the technology, the competitive dynamics. They can evaluate an acquisition target better than any outside consultant or investment banker ever could. When they buy that bolt-on business, it gets folded into their existing operations. Same management team running a bigger operation. No new direct reports for me. No additional complexity at the Berkshire level.\n\nThe economics are compelling. These bolt-ons deploy capital at attractive returns because our managers are buying businesses they understand intimately. They're not paying investment bankers huge fees. They're often buying from owners who prefer dealing with a strategic buyer who understands and values what they've built, rather than going through an auction process. And once the acquisition is complete, there are real synergies - and I don't mean the made-up kind that investment bankers put in presentations to justify overpaying. I mean actual cost savings from combining operations, real revenue enhancements from cross-selling, genuine efficiency gains from eliminating duplicate functions.\n\nHere's what really excites me: this strategy scales beautifully. We can do dozens of these deals simultaneously across our various businesses. While one of our manufacturing companies is buying a bolt-on, one of our retailers might be doing the same thing, and one of our service businesses might be doing another. Each deal might be $50 million or $200 million - not material to Berkshire's overall results individually, but collectively they add up to serious money. And each one makes the underlying business stronger and more valuable.\n\nCompare this to trying to do dozens of large standalone acquisitions. That would be a nightmare. We'd need a huge corporate staff to evaluate deals, integrate companies, monitor performance. We'd lose the decentralized culture that makes Berkshire work. The beauty of bolt-ons is that they leverage our existing structure. Our operating managers are doing what they do best - building their businesses - and we're simply providing the capital and the permanent home that makes these acquisitions possible.\n\nThere's also a defensive element here. In many industries, scale matters. By helping our businesses grow through bolt-ons, we're strengthening their competitive positions. A bigger, more efficient operation can invest more in technology, offer better service, and weather downturns more easily than a smaller competitor.\n\nSo when I say these deals require no additional work for us yet produce more earnings, I mean it literally. The work happens at the operating company level, where the expertise resides. The earnings flow up to Berkshire. And we can keep doing this year after year, decade after decade, steadily building the value of our operating businesses without adding bureaucracy or complexity at headquarters. That's a formula I never get tired of."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "This gets right to the heart of how we think about capital allocation at Berkshire, and it's one of the most important lessons I can share with investors. The answer is straightforward: it's the quality of the business and the return on capital that matters, not the percentage you own.\n\nLet me walk you through the mathematics and logic. When you own 100% of a business earning 5% on equity, you get all of that 5%. But when you own 10% of a business earning 30% on equity, your share of those economics is far superior. The compounding works in your favor dramatically over time. A wonderful business will compound your wealth at rates that a mediocre business simply cannot match, regardless of your ownership percentage. This is why we're perfectly content owning 9.3% of Coca-Cola or 15.6% of American Express rather than owning 100% of a furniture store earning modest returns.\n\nNow, there's another critical dimension here that many investors miss. When you own a minority stake in a publicly traded company run by excellent managers, you get several advantages. First, you don't have to do anything. The talented, shareholder-oriented managers at these companies – and that description certainly fits the leaders at our Big Four – are working for you every day, making thousands of decisions, allocating capital, and building value. Second, you have liquidity. If circumstances change, we can adjust our position. Third, and this is crucial, these businesses have access to capital markets and can repurchase shares when they're undervalued, which increases our ownership percentage without us spending a dime.\n\nLook at what I mentioned in the excerpt: stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express increased our ownership percentages, and each one percentage point increase across the Big Four adds about $500 million to our share of their annual earnings. That's the magic of owning pieces of wonderful businesses run by managers who understand capital allocation.\n\nThe Hope Diamond analogy captures this perfectly. The Hope Diamond is extraordinarily valuable – its quality, rarity, and characteristics make it special. A rhinestone, no matter how large, is fundamentally common and low-value. If someone offered you a choice between owning 10% of the Hope Diamond or 100% of a rhinestone, you'd take the partial interest in the Diamond every time if you understood value.\n\nThere's also a practical consideration. When we buy 100% of a business, we're responsible for everything – management succession, capital allocation, dealing with problems. When we own a substantial but non-controlling stake in a wonderful company with great management, they handle all of that. We get to participate in excellent economics without the operational burden. That's an ideal situation.\n\nThe key insight is this: focus on the quality of what you own and the returns it generates, not on the percentage you control. Over time, your share of a wonderful company's growing earnings will far exceed what you'd earn owning all of something mediocre. That's not just theory – it's exactly what's happened with our Big Four investments, where our portion of their earnings was $4.7 billion in 2015, even though we only received $1.8 billion in dividends. Those retained earnings are working for us, compounding at high rates inside excellent businesses."

        "value": "You emphasize extreme decentralization at Berkshire and quote Charlie's advice about not trying to change people's behavior. How does this management philosophy connect to your approach to acquisitions and partnerships, particularly your insistence on only making friendly deals?"
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The connection between our decentralized management style and our acquisition approach is fundamental to how Berkshire operates, and it all stems from a basic understanding of human nature and what actually works in business over the long term.\n\nLet me start with the decentralization principle. When we acquire a business like PCC, we're buying it precisely because it's been run well by cost-conscious, efficient managers. These people have built something valuable through their own judgment, their own decision-making, and their own work ethic. The absolute worst thing we could do is show up after the purchase and start telling them how to run their business differently. Charlie's marriage analogy is perfect here – if you marry someone thinking you'll change them, you're headed for misery. The same applies to acquisitions.\n\nOur job after buying a business is simple: create an environment where these excellent managers can maximize both their effectiveness and their enjoyment of their work. Notice I said \"enjoyment\" – that's not incidental. When talented people love what they're doing and feel trusted and respected, they perform at their highest level. When they feel micromanaged or second-guessed, even the best managers become demoralized and less effective. We've seen this play out over decades with our subsidiaries. The managers who've been with us the longest consistently tell us that our hands-off approach is liberating and allows them to focus on running their businesses rather than managing up to headquarters.\n\nThis philosophy directly connects to why we only make friendly acquisitions. Think about what a hostile takeover represents: you're essentially telling the current management and board that you know better than they do, that you're going to come in and change things, that their judgment has been inadequate. Even if that's sometimes true – and I acknowledge that some CEOs do forget they work for shareholders, and some managers are genuinely inept – it sets up an adversarial relationship from day one.\n\nWe don't want to operate that way. When we acquire a company, we want the existing management to stay, to feel good about the transaction, and to run the business with the same passion and effectiveness they showed before. That only happens when they want us as owners, when they view Berkshire as the ideal permanent home for the business they've built. You simply cannot achieve that dynamic through a hostile takeover.\n\nThere's also a practical element. The businesses we want to own are the ones run by managers who are already doing an excellent job. Why would we want to antagonize and potentially lose those very people? If a business needs to be fixed or dramatically changed, it's probably not the kind of wonderful business we want to own in the first place. We're looking for businesses that are already wonderful, run by people who are already doing things right.\n\nThis extends to our partnership approach as well. When we partner with Jorge Paulo's group or others, we do so because we respect their abilities and judgment. We're not partnering with people we intend to override or control. We go where we're welcome, whether that's as a full acquirer, a financing partner, or a combined partner. This approach has served us extraordinarily well.\n\nThe broader lesson is about working with human nature rather than against it. Trust, autonomy, and mutual respect are not soft concepts – they're the foundation of sustainable business success. When you find good people doing good work, your job is to support them, not to change them. That's true whether you're managing a subsidiary, making an acquisition, or forming a partnership. It's almost unheard of in corporate America, but it works."

        "value": "The ability to deploy capital in two fundamentally different ways – buying entire businesses or making passive minority investments in public companies – gives us an enormous advantage that most companies simply don't have. And it's not just a marginal edge; it's transformative to how we can put money to work.\n\nLet me explain why this matters so much. Most corporations limit themselves to one lane. They only look at acquisitions they can control and operate. That's a pretty narrow funnel. You're competing with private equity firms, strategic buyers, and you're limited to situations where the seller wants to give up control entirely. The universe of opportunities at any given moment might be quite small, and when you're generating the kind of cash Berkshire generates, you need a lot of places to potentially deploy it.\n\nNow, when you add the second lane – passive investments in marketable securities – you've suddenly expanded your opportunity set enormously. There are thousands of publicly traded companies we can invest in. We don't need the current owner to want to sell. We don't need to negotiate a control premium. We don't need management to retire or a family to decide they're done running the business. We just need to find businesses selling at sensible prices relative to their intrinsic value.\n\nThe Woody Allen line, while humorous, captures something important. If you're only looking in one place for opportunities, you're going to have a lot of dry spells. When whole businesses are overpriced or unavailable, we can shift to marketable securities. When stocks are overvalued across the board, we can focus on acquisitions or just hold cash. This flexibility means we're almost never stuck.\n\nBut there's another crucial element I mentioned that people often overlook. That huge portfolio of marketable securities – which now runs into the hundreds of billions – serves as a war chest. When an elephant-sized acquisition comes along, we can write a check immediately. We don't need to arrange financing. We don't need to sell crown jewel assets. We can just liquidate some securities and move. That optionality is extraordinarily valuable.\n\nThink about it from a seller's perspective too. If you're selling a large business, who do you want to deal with? Someone who needs to line up financing and might not close? Or Berkshire, which can wire the money tomorrow? That certainty of execution has helped us win deals.\n\nThe companies that limit themselves to only operating businesses they control are making a choice, often driven by ego or organizational structure. CEOs like empires they can run. But that preference costs their shareholders opportunities. We've never let that kind of thinking constrain us. A dollar deployed wisely in a passive investment is just as good as a dollar deployed in an acquisition – sometimes better, because we're not paying a control premium.\n\nThis dual approach also keeps us disciplined. When acquisition prices get silly, we have somewhere else to go. We're never forced to do a dumb deal just because the cash is burning a hole in our pocket. That's a huge advantage in maintaining rationality over decades."

        "value": "I get asked about this constantly, and the pessimism people express just doesn't match the mathematics or the historical reality. Let me walk you through why I'm so confident about America's future, even when the political rhetoric suggests we're going to hell in a handbasket.\n\nStart with the basic facts. GDP per capita in America today is about $56,000. When I was born in 1930, that figure in real terms – meaning adjusted for inflation – was six times less. Six times! My parents, who were sensible people, couldn't have imagined the prosperity we have today. They didn't lack imagination; the leap was just that enormous.\n\nNow, here's the critical question: Why did this happen? It's not because Americans today are smarter than Americans in 1930. We're not. It's not because we work harder – if anything, we work fewer hours. The answer is productivity. We've learned to work far more efficiently. We produce far more output per hour of work. That's the magic of economic progress, and it's powered by innovation, capital investment, and the accumulation of knowledge.\n\nThis trend isn't stopping. Yet I constantly hear people complaining that 2% GDP growth is disappointing. They want more, and sure, we'd all prefer 3% or 4%. But let's actually do the math on what 2% delivers, because this is where people's intuition fails them.\n\nIf overall GDP grows at 2% and population grows at 0.8% – which is roughly where we are, combining natural increase and immigration – then per capita GDP grows at about 1.2% annually. Now, 1.2% doesn't sound like much. In one year, it isn't much. But we don't live one year; we live generations.\n\nTake a 25-year generation. If you simply multiplied 1.2% times 25, you'd get 30%. But that's not how compound growth works. When you compound 1.2% for 25 years, you get 34.4% growth. That's more than a third increase in real living standards in a single generation. The baby born today will, by age 25, live in an America that produces 34% more per person than we do now.\n\nThink about what that means practically. Better medical care. Better technology. Better housing. More entertainment options. More of everything. And that's with the \"disappointing\" 2% growth rate everyone complains about!\n\nHere's what really gets lost in election-year rhetoric: politicians focus on problems because that's how they get elected. \"Everything's great, vote for me\" isn't a compelling message. So we get this drumbeat of negativity that convinces people their children will be worse off. It's simply not true, and the mathematics prove it.\n\nThe power of compound growth is something people consistently underestimate. Small percentages, maintained over time, produce enormous changes. We've seen this throughout American history. There's no reason to think it stops now. We have the same innovative spirit, the same market system, the same rule of law, the same accumulation of knowledge that produced the last century of progress.\n\nCould we do better than 2%? Sure. Should we try? Absolutely. But even at 2%, the future is remarkably bright. The babies born today are inheriting an economic machine that, while imperfect, has proven itself over and over. They'll face challenges, as every generation does, but they're starting from a base of prosperity that would have seemed like fantasy to my parents' generation. That's not optimism; that's mathematics and history."

The key insight is that the size of the pie and how you slice it are two different matters entirely. Both can be true simultaneously – the pie keeps growing while people argue intensely about their share.\n\nLet me walk you through the arithmetic first, because it's really quite remarkable. A 1.2% annual growth rate in real GDP per capita doesn't sound like much, does it? But compound that over 25 years and you get a 34.4% increase. For the next generation, that translates to $19,000 more per person in today's dollars, or $76,000 for a family of four. That's not speculation – that's just math, and it's conservative math based on historical trends.\n\nNow here's where people get confused. They think that because there will be political battles over distribution, somehow the overall progress is threatened or that these fights are evidence of failure. That's completely backwards. The fights over distribution have been going on since the beginning of human civilization. They happened when the pie was tiny, and they'll continue when the pie is enormous. Congress will always be a battlefield with money and votes as weapons. Lobbying will always be a growth industry. That's just human nature and democratic politics at work.\n\nBut – and this is the critical point – even while these battles rage, the market system keeps producing more goods and services. It keeps innovating and creating things people want, and even more impressively, things people don't yet know they want. I use myself as an example in the letter. My parents couldn't envision a television. I didn't think I needed a personal computer in my 50s. Now I spend ten hours a week playing bridge online and use search constantly. The market delivered all of this without anyone specifically planning for it.\n\nThe Rockefeller comparison really drives this home. Here was the richest man in America when I was born, and yet my middle-class neighbors today enjoy a better living standard in transportation, entertainment, communication, and medical services. His money couldn't buy what we take for granted. That's not because wealth redistribution made my neighbors richer – it's because innovation and economic growth made everyone richer.\n\nSo yes, there will be fierce political battles. Some groups will feel like they're \"losing\" relative to others. The person whose skills aren't valued by the marketplace will earn less than someone with talents the market prizes. That inequality will create tension and conflict. But even those on the \"losing\" side of these political battles will almost certainly have more goods and services, of better quality, than they have today. A \"loser\" in 2050's political battles will likely live better than a middle-class person today.\n\nThe pessimists focus on the distribution fights and conclude America is in decline. The optimists – and I count myself firmly in this camp – recognize that the growth of the pie swamps the distribution arguments. For 240 years, betting against America has been a terrible mistake. The golden goose keeps laying more and larger eggs, regardless of how we argue about dividing them up."

We're not relying on genius or market timing or complex financial engineering. We're relying on things that have worked in business for centuries and will continue working long after Charlie and I are gone.\n\nLet me take you through why each element matters and how they work together. First, constantly improving the basic earning power of our subsidiaries. This isn't rocket science – it's about making our businesses better operators year after year. Better products, better service, lower costs, stronger competitive positions. This is blocking and tackling, the fundamental work of business management. Any competent manager can understand this principle, and our operating managers have proven they excel at it. They don't need me or Charlie looking over their shoulders to know that improving earning power is their primary job.\n\nSecond, bolt-on acquisitions. Notice I said \"bolt-on,\" not transformative deals. We're talking about our existing businesses adding complementary operations that fit naturally with what they already do. Our managers know their industries intimately. They know which acquisitions make sense and which don't. This doesn't require special insight from headquarters – it requires industry knowledge and discipline, both of which our managers possess.\n\nThird, benefiting from the growth of our investees. This is perhaps the easiest element of all. We own pieces of wonderful businesses – companies with strong competitive advantages, excellent management, and good reinvestment opportunities. We don't have to do anything except sit back and let them compound. As I noted in discussing America's economic future, the tailwind of economic growth will lift these businesses. Our job is simply not to interfere with that process.\n\nFourth, repurchasing shares when they're available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value. This is pure arithmetic. If we can buy dollar bills for 80 cents or 85 cents, we should do it. It increases the per-share value for continuing shareholders. The key word is \"meaningful\" discount – we're not going to pay 98 cents for a dollar. Future managers will need to estimate intrinsic value, but they'll have all our financial statements, they'll know the businesses intimately, and they'll have a board to consult with. The math isn't that hard.\n\nFifth, making an occasional large acquisition. Notice I said \"occasional.\" We're not promising to do one every year or even every five years. When opportunities appear at sensible prices, we'll act. When they don't, we won't. This requires patience and discipline, but not brilliance.\n\nNow here's why I'm confident this will work. Every element of this blueprint benefits from the favorable tailwind I described earlier – America's continued economic growth. Our subsidiaries will improve their earning power more easily in a growing economy. Bolt-on acquisitions will be more valuable when the underlying businesses are growing. Our investees will prosper as America prospers. Even our acquisition opportunities improve because we'll have more capital to deploy as our businesses generate more cash.\n\nThe blueprint also doesn't depend on predicting the future or making brilliant tactical decisions. We're not trying to time markets or identify the next hot sector. We're simply trying to own good businesses, make them better, and allocate capital sensibly. These are timeless principles that work in any economic environment, but work especially well with a tailwind.\n\nMost importantly, this blueprint is self-reinforcing. As we execute on these five points, we generate more capital, which allows us to execute on them more effectively, which generates still more capital. It's a virtuous cycle that compounds over time, just like America's 1.2% annual growth compounds into substantial gains over a generation."

Let me explain why this matters so much, because it's really quite simple when you think it through.\n\nWhen we talk about building value at Berkshire, we're always focused on per-share value, not aggregate value. This distinction is crucial. If I own a pizza and I cut it into eight slices instead of four, I don't have more pizza – I just have smaller pieces. The same principle applies to shares of stock. If Berkshire issues new shares, we're dividing the same underlying business value among more owners, which dilutes each existing shareholder's stake.\n\nNow, let's connect this to our five-point blueprint. Every single one of those strategies – improving subsidiary earnings, making bolt-on acquisitions, benefiting from investee growth, repurchasing shares, and making occasional large acquisitions – is designed to increase the value of the business. But here's the key: if we're simultaneously issuing shares, we're working against ourselves. It's like trying to fill a bathtub while the drain is open. You might still make progress, but you're making it much harder than it needs to be.\n\nThink about it this way: suppose we improve our subsidiaries' earning power by ten percent, which increases Berkshire's total value by ten percent. That's wonderful work. But if we then issue ten percent more shares to finance some acquisition or for any other reason, the per-share value hasn't increased at all. Each shareholder is right back where they started, despite all that operational improvement.\n\nThis is why I've always been so careful about acquisitions that require us to issue stock. When we use cash to buy a business, we're exchanging one asset for another, and if we've paid a fair price, our shareholders maintain their proportional ownership of a now-larger enterprise. But when we issue shares, we're giving away pieces of everything Berkshire owns – all our wonderful businesses, all our investments, everything – and we need to receive something of truly equivalent value in return.\n\nThe math here is unforgiving. If Berkshire shares are trading below intrinsic value and we issue them, we're selling dollars for eighty cents or ninety cents. That's value destruction, plain and simple. Even if the shares are fairly valued, issuing them means our existing shareholders are simply sharing their ownership with new partners without gaining anything in return, unless what we're acquiring is worth more than what we're giving up.\n\nThis principle also explains why share repurchases, our fourth point, can be so powerful. When we buy back shares at a discount to intrinsic value, we're doing the opposite of issuing shares – we're increasing each remaining shareholder's stake in the business without them having to invest another dollar. It's accretive to per-share value.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Charlie and I view Berkshire shares as ownership units in a collection of wonderful businesses. We treat them with the respect they deserve. Issuing them casually or unnecessarily would be a betrayal of the partners who have entrusted their capital to us. That's why future managers must maintain this discipline – it's essential to the entire value-building enterprise."

        "value": "This is an excellent question because it touches on something that's often misunderstood: the difference between being conservative and being stubborn. Conservative assumptions are meant to protect against uncertainty, not to ignore reality indefinitely. Let me walk you through our thinking on this evolution.\n\nWhen Charlie and I first established our framework for valuing Berkshire using those two quantitative pillars – per-share cash and investments, and per-share business earnings – we deliberately excluded insurance underwriting income from the earnings calculation. This wasn't an oversight; it was a conscious decision based on the nature of our insurance business at that time. We were heavily involved in catastrophe coverages, which meant our results could swing wildly from year to year. One major hurricane or earthquake could wipe out several years of underwriting profits. In that environment, assuming breakeven underwriting over time was the prudent, conservative approach.\n\nBut businesses evolve, and our analytical frameworks need to evolve with them. Over the past decade or two, we've fundamentally transformed our insurance operations. We've deemphasized those volatile catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded what I call our bread-and-butter lines of business – the steady, predictable insurance products that generate more consistent results year after year. This wasn't a sudden shift; it was a gradual, deliberate repositioning of our insurance portfolio.\n\nThe numbers tell the story. Over the past decade, our annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share. That's not a one-year fluke; that's a sustained pattern of profitability. In 2015 alone, underwriting contributed $1,118 per share to our total business earnings of $12,304 per share. That's nearly ten percent of our business earnings coming from a source we were previously excluding from our valuation framework. At some point, continuing to ignore this income stream would have shifted from being conservative to being unrealistic.\n\nNow, I want to be clear about something important: including underwriting income in our earnings doesn't mean we're guaranteeing profits every year. I explicitly stated that underwriting in any given year could well be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so. We're not abandoning conservatism; we're updating our assumptions to reflect the changed character of our business. There's a big difference between those two things.\n\nThis evolution teaches us several important lessons about valuation and business analysis. First, conservative assumptions should be based on the actual risks and characteristics of the business, not applied mechanically forever. When we assumed breakeven underwriting, we had good reason – the volatility was real and significant. As that volatility decreased through changes in our business mix, the rationale for that assumption weakened.\n\nSecond, there's value in consistency, but not at the expense of accuracy. We maintained our original methodology for many years, which allowed for meaningful comparisons over time. But eventually, the business had changed enough that maintaining the old approach would have distorted rather than clarified our true earning power.\n\nThird, transparency matters enormously. Notice that I've explained exactly what we're doing and why. I've highlighted the change in italics, discussed the reasoning, and cautioned that underwriting can still be unprofitable in any given year. We're not trying to make our numbers look better through accounting gimmicks; we're trying to give you a clearer picture of Berkshire's actual economic reality.\n\nThe broader principle here is that good analysis requires judgment, not just formulas. You need to understand the underlying business realities and adjust your analytical framework when those realities change materially. That's what we've done with insurance underwriting, and it's what thoughtful investors should do in evaluating any business over time."

        "value": "This is one of the most important concepts for understanding how we think about our insurance operations, and it gets to the heart of why accounting numbers don't always tell you what a business is really worth.\n\nWhen you look at Berkshire's balance sheet, you'll see our float – which was running around $88 billion at the time I wrote this – listed as a liability. And technically, that's correct. We owe this money to policyholders for claims that will eventually be paid. The accountants require us to show it that way, and we have no quarrel with that treatment. But if you stop your analysis there, you're missing the entire economic picture.\n\nHere's what makes float so special: it's a revolving fund. Every single day, we're paying out claims – $24.5 billion in 2015 alone, going to more than six million claimants. That money goes out the door, and our float goes down. But here's the key – every single day, we're also writing new policies. Those new policies generate new premiums, and with those premiums come new future claims obligations. So the float gets replenished. It revolves.\n\nNow, let me give you an analogy. Imagine you have two different $1 debts. The first debt is to your neighbor, and he's moving to Australia tomorrow. You have to pay him that dollar, and once it's gone, it's gone forever. The second debt is different – you owe a dollar to a revolving fund that, as long as you're in business doing what you do, will always have a dollar in it. You might pay out that specific dollar, but another dollar immediately takes its place. These are economically very different situations, even though they're both listed as $1 liabilities on your balance sheet.\n\nOur insurance float is like that second dollar. As long as we're writing good business – and we've been doing that for 13 consecutive years with an underwriting profit – that float isn't going anywhere. It might decline gradually, maybe 3% in a bad year, but it's not disappearing. It's permanent capital, or close to it.\n\nNow here's where it gets really interesting. If we can generate that float at no cost – meaning we break even or make an underwriting profit – then we have permanent capital that costs us nothing. In fact, when we make an underwriting profit, we're actually getting paid to hold other people's money. We had a $26.2 billion pre-tax underwriting gain over those 13 years. That means we were paid $26.2 billion to hold an average of roughly $70-80 billion in float.\n\nSo when you're thinking about intrinsic value, you can't just subtract the full float amount as if it's a conventional liability. The economic value of owing money that never leaves – that's costless or better – is dramatically different from owing money you'll have to pay back. The accounting liability and the economic liability are two very different things. This is why our insurance operations are so valuable, and why we've made them such a cornerstone of Berkshire's fortress-like financial structure."

        "value": "This question gets at a fundamental tension in the insurance business, and it explains why most insurance companies are mediocre businesses while ours has been quite good.\n\nLet me start with why the industry as a whole struggles. Insurance float is enormously attractive – it's money you get to invest while you're holding it for future claims. Every insurance company understands this, and they all want more of it. This creates ferocious competition. When everyone wants the same thing, they start bidding against each other, and in insurance, that bidding takes the form of lower prices for policies. Companies start underpricing risk just to get the premium dollars in the door and generate that attractive float.\n\nThe math here is seductive but dangerous. An insurer might think, \"Well, even if I take a small underwriting loss, I'll make it up with investment income on the float.\" And sometimes that works. But when everyone thinks this way simultaneously, underwriting losses balloon. The industry ends up paying dearly for its float – sometimes more than the float is worth. It's a classic case of a good idea that gets ruined by too many people having the same good idea at the same time.\n\nNow add in the current environment of low interest rates, which was particularly acute when I wrote this. If you're earning less on your investments, that float becomes less valuable, but the competitive dynamics don't change. Companies still want float, so they keep underpricing. The industry's returns on tangible net worth have been subnormal compared to American business generally, and I predicted they'd get worse, especially in reinsurance.\n\nSo how have we avoided this trap for 13 consecutive years? It comes down to discipline, and this is where the \"Old Testament\" reference comes in. I'm not talking about casual discipline or lip service. Every insurance company claims to be disciplined about underwriting. They all say the right things. But when the market gets competitive and premium volume starts to decline, most companies cave. They start writing business at inadequate prices because they're worried about losing market share, or their producers are complaining, or Wall Street is asking why their top line isn't growing.\n\nAt Berkshire, we simply won't do this. Our insurance managers – Ajit Jain, the folks at GEICO, our reinsurance operations – they all understand that float is only valuable if it's generated at the right price. They know that expensive float is worse than no float at all. And critically, they know I will support them completely if they choose to walk away from business that's inadequately priced. We've shrunk our premium volume in certain lines many times when pricing got irrational.\n\nThis is what I mean by \"Old Testament style\" – it's absolute, it's non-negotiable, it's fundamental to who we are. There's no winking at it, no exceptions for special circumstances, no \"just this once.\" When the pricing isn't right, we don't write the business, period. This discipline is evaluated daily by our managers. It's not a quarterly review or an annual strategy session – it's the daily focus.\n\nThe beautiful thing is that this discipline is self-reinforcing. When the market gets competitive and pricing is terrible, we pull back. We don't generate much new float, but we're not destroying value either. Then, inevitably, the cycle turns. Some companies that wrote bad business fail or pull back. Prices firm up. And suddenly we're there, with our capital intact and our reputation solid, ready to write enormous amounts of business at attractive prices. This patience – this willingness to do nothing when the opportunity isn't right – is what separates us from an industry that feels compelled to keep the machine running regardless of price."

        "value": "This is one of the most important distinctions an investor can make, and frankly, it's one where GAAP accounting completely fails us. The fundamental issue is that accounting rules treat all intangible assets the same way, when in reality they're as different as night and day from an economic standpoint.\n\nLet me walk you through the logic. When we acquire a company, purchase-accounting rules require us to identify and value various intangible assets – things like software, customer relationships, brand names, and so forth. GAAP then requires us to amortize many of these assets over time, recording those amortization charges as expenses that reduce reported earnings. Now here's the critical point: some of these charges represent real economic costs, while others are purely fictional expenses that have no bearing on the actual value being created or destroyed in the business.\n\nTake software as my example of a \"real\" intangible. Software genuinely does become obsolete. It needs to be updated, replaced, and maintained. If you develop or acquire software today, in five or ten years it'll likely need to be rebuilt from scratch. So when we amortize software costs, we're recognizing a true economic reality – that asset is actually depleting, and we'll need to spend real money in the future to replace it. Those amortization charges reflect genuine expenses.\n\nNow contrast that with something like customer relationships. When we acquire a business, accountants assign a value to the existing customer relationships and then require us to amortize that value over time. But think about what's really happening in a well-run business. Are those customer relationships actually declining in value? In most cases, absolutely not. In fact, if we're doing our job right, we're strengthening those relationships every year. We're adding new customers while keeping the old ones happy. The notion that we should record an expense for the \"depletion\" of these relationships is absurd – it's an accounting fiction created by purchase-accounting rules, not an economic reality.\n\nHere's why this matters enormously to investors. At Berkshire, we now have about $1.1 billion in annual amortization charges. I estimate only about 20% of that – roughly $220 million – represents real economic costs. The other $880 million or so is just accounting noise. If you're trying to figure out Berkshire's true earning power, you need to add most of that amortization back. Otherwise, you're understating our real economics by nearly a billion dollars a year.\n\nThis problem keeps growing for us as we make more acquisitions, and it'll keep growing for any successful acquirer. The perverse result is that our GAAP earnings are artificially depressed today, but they'll get an artificial boost later when these phantom assets are fully amortized. That's why I joked about it being \"my gift to my successor\" – eventually reported earnings will jump even if the underlying business performance stays flat.\n\nThe lesson for investors is clear: you've got to look beneath the GAAP numbers and understand the economic reality of what you own. Don't just accept reported earnings at face value. Think critically about which expenses are real and which are accounting artifacts."

It's not a subtle accounting question or a gray area – it's managers and analysts conspiring to mislead investors about basic economic reality. The name itself gives away the game: \"stock-based compensation.\" It's compensation. That means it's an expense. End of story.\n\nLet me explain why this matters and why it's so pernicious. When a company pays an employee with cash, everyone agrees that's an expense that should reduce reported earnings. Nobody would dream of saying, \"Well, let's just ignore those salary payments when we calculate our profits.\" That would be absurd. But when a company pays an employee with stock or stock options instead of cash, suddenly we're supposed to pretend it's not really an expense? The logic is completely backwards.\n\nHere's the economic reality: when you give stock or options to employees, you're diluting existing shareholders. You're transferring value from current owners to employees. That's a real cost, just as real as if you'd paid cash. In fact, it's often worse than cash compensation because it's hidden and because managements tend to be far more generous with stock than they would be with cash coming directly out of the corporate treasury.\n\nNow, I understand why managers want to exclude stock-based compensation from earnings. It makes their numbers look better. It makes their performance appear stronger. And in many cases, their own bonuses are tied to these phony earnings figures, so they have a direct financial incentive to play this game. But understanding why they do it doesn't make it any less dishonest.\n\nWhat really troubles me is the role that Wall Street analysts play in perpetuating this charade. These are supposed to be the professionals who protect investors by providing independent analysis. Instead, many of them simply parrot back the fake numbers that management feeds them. They talk about \"adjusted earnings\" or \"earnings before stock-based compensation\" as if these figures were more meaningful than GAAP earnings, when in fact they're less meaningful because they ignore real expenses.\n\nWhy do analysts go along with this? I see three possibilities, none of them good. First, maybe they genuinely don't understand the economics – they don't grasp that compensation is compensation regardless of the form it takes. If that's the case, they shouldn't be analyzing companies. Second, maybe they're afraid of losing access to management. If they challenge the company's preferred narrative, maybe they won't get invited to the conference calls or the management meetings. That's putting their own interests ahead of their clients. Third, maybe they're just cynical – everyone else is playing the game, so why rock the boat?\n\nThe broader principle here is about intellectual honesty in business. When you're reporting results to owners, you have an obligation to present the economic reality as clearly and honestly as possible. You don't get to pick and choose which expenses count and which don't based on what makes you look good. Real expenses belong in the calculation of real earnings, period.\n\nFor investors, this issue is a useful litmus test. When you see a management team that routinely trumpets \"adjusted\" earnings that exclude stock-based compensation, you're seeing a management team that's willing to mislead you about basic economics. That should make you very cautious about everything else they tell you. Conversely, managements that report honestly and don't play these games are showing you something important about their character and their respect for shareholders."

That's my polite way of saying they're not being honest with you.\n\nHere's the fundamental reality: our machinery, equipment, and physical assets wear out. They deteriorate with use and time. At Berkshire, I've been trying for 51 years to figure out how to keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, and I haven't managed to do it yet. That should tell you something. The depreciation we record isn't some abstract accounting concept – it represents the real consumption of our productive assets that must be replaced if we want to stay in business.\n\nTake our railroad, BNSF, as a perfect example. The depreciation charge we record actually falls short of what we need to spend just to keep the railroad running properly. Think about that. Even our GAAP depreciation, which some people want to ignore entirely, understates the true economic cost. Rails wear out. Locomotives need replacing. Bridges require maintenance and eventual reconstruction. If we don't spend that money, we don't have a railroad anymore. This mismatch means our GAAP earnings at BNSF are actually higher than our true economic earnings, and this same overstatement exists at all railroads.\n\nNow, why do analysts and investment bankers push these misleading numbers? I see several reasons. Some genuinely don't understand business economics – they've confused cash flow with owner earnings. Others fear losing access to management if they're too critical. Some are just cynical, figuring that since everyone else is playing the game, they might as well go along. Whatever their reasoning, they're propagating numbers that deceive investors, and that's simply wrong.\n\nThe danger here is that investors might overpay for businesses when they ignore depreciation. A company might show impressive EBITDA, but if it requires constant capital investment just to maintain its competitive position, the true earnings available to owners are much lower. You could buy what looks like a profitable business and discover you're on a treadmill, constantly reinvesting just to stand still.\n\nAt Berkshire, our public reports will continue to conform to GAAP – we follow the rules. But to embrace reality, you need to think about what the numbers really mean. For most of our businesses, you should add back the amortization charges we report because those often relate to accounting allocations rather than economic reality. But you should also subtract something to reflect BNSF's inadequate depreciation charge. The goal isn't to manipulate numbers to look better; it's to understand the true economics of the business. That's how you make intelligent investment decisions, and that's the honesty investors deserve from the people who are supposed to be helping them understand businesses."

The only thing I can hope for is that future errors occur at our smaller operations rather than our larger ones. But let me walk you through how I think about these mistakes and what they teach us about investing and management.\n\nWhen I look at our poor performers, I see two main categories of error. First, I was sometimes wrong in evaluating the economic dynamics of the company or the industry it operates in. I thought I understood the competitive position, the durability of the franchise, or the industry structure, but I didn't. We're now paying the price for those misjudgments. Second, I stumbled in evaluating people – either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. These are fundamental errors in the two most important aspects of capital allocation: understanding the business and understanding the people running it.\n\nHere's what's important to understand: even with these mistakes, when you view our manufacturing, service, and retailing operations as a single entity, they're an excellent business. They employed an average of $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital, despite holding large quantities of excess cash and using only token amounts of leverage. Some businesses in this group produce returns from 25% after-tax to far more than 100% on unleveraged net tangible assets. Others generate good returns in the 12% to 20% range. The poor performers are a minority.\n\nThis illustrates a crucial principle: diversification and portfolio thinking matter. If you make enough good decisions and size them appropriately, the mistakes become manageable. They hurt – believe me, I feel every one of them – but they don't sink the ship. The key is making sure your winners are bigger than your losers and that you have enough winners to overcome the inevitable mistakes.\n\nNow, about paying substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses – that's reflected in the large goodwill and intangibles figure on our balance sheet. This is where people sometimes get confused. A business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if you pay too high a price. We've paid up for quality, but overall, we're getting a decent return on the capital deployed in this sector.\n\nThe lesson for investors is this: acknowledge reality. Don't pretend your mistakes don't exist or try to hide them in corporate-speak. I tell our shareholders directly that I've made serious mistakes because that's the truth, and they deserve the truth. This honesty serves several purposes. It keeps me humble and focused on learning from errors. It sets realistic expectations – if I'm telling you I'll make more mistakes, you won't be shocked when they happen. And it establishes trust, which is the foundation of the relationship between managers and owners.\n\nThe practical takeaway is that investing isn't about perfection; it's about maintaining a high batting average and making sure your hits are bigger than your misses. Accept that you'll be wrong sometimes, try to learn from those errors, and structure your affairs so that mistakes are painful but not fatal. That's how you survive and prosper over the long term."

When Clayton originates a mortgage and keeps it, we live with that decision for decades. Every mistake costs us real money – not theoretical money, not someone else's money, but our money. And that changes everything about how you approach the business.\n\nLet me walk you through why this matters so much. In the years leading up to 2008, the mortgage industry operated on what I call a \"hot potato\" model. An originator in California would make a loan, collect a fee, and immediately sell that mortgage to an investment bank in New York. That bank would bundle it with thousands of other mortgages, slice and dice them into complex securities, collect their fees, and sell these packages to pension funds, insurance companies, and investors worldwide. At every step, people made money on volume and mark-ups, but nobody – and I mean nobody – had to live with the consequences if those loans went bad.\n\nThis creates perverse incentives. If you're getting paid based on how many mortgages you originate, and you're selling them off before the ink is dry, why would you be careful? In fact, being careful hurts you because the gamiest credits – the ones most likely to default – often generated the highest fees. So originators looked the other way when borrowers lied on applications. They made loans to people who clearly couldn't afford them. The worse the loan, the more profit they made, because they'd be long gone when the trouble started.\n\nNow contrast that with Clayton's approach. Last year we foreclosed on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost of $157 million. That's real money coming out of our pocket – money that completely dwarfs whatever profit we made when we originally sold those homes. When you know you're going to eat every loss, you become very, very careful about who you lend to and on what terms.\n\nThis isn't just about being virtuous – it's about proper incentive alignment. When we evaluate a loan application at Clayton, we're not thinking about this quarter's origination volume. We're thinking about whether this borrower can make payments for the next twenty years. We're thinking about what happens if they lose their job, or if housing prices decline in their area, or if interest rates rise. We're conservative because we have to be.\n\nThe broader principle here applies far beyond mortgages. Whenever you separate decision-making from consequences, you get bad decisions. It's that simple. The person making the choice needs to live with the results. When Wall Street created this elaborate chain where originators, packagers, rating agencies, and salesmen all collected fees while passing risk to the next guy, disaster was inevitable. Nobody had an incentive to say \"no\" to a bad loan because saying \"yes\" was so profitable and someone else would bear the cost.\n\nSociety needs mortgage originators to have substantial skin in the game – whether that's 5%, 25%, or in our case 100%. Without it, you're relying on people's better angels to overcome powerful financial incentives to do the wrong thing. History shows that doesn't work out well."

Investment banks would take thousands of individual mortgages and pool them together, then slice that pool into different tranches with different risk levels. Already, you've created something that requires enormous effort to analyze properly. But they didn't stop there. They then took the riskiest, junkiest portions of these primary offerings and created a second layer of securities based on those pieces. To properly evaluate just one of these second-layer securities, an investor would need to read tens of thousands of pages of documentation and understand the credit quality of thousands of underlying mortgages, the legal structures of multiple entities, the correlation assumptions between different mortgage pools, and the waterfall of payments through various tranches.\n\nNow here's the key insight: this complexity wasn't an unfortunate byproduct of financial innovation – it was the entire point. Wall Street salesmen were making millions annually selling these products precisely because their customers couldn't understand them. If the products were simple and transparent, customers would quickly figure out they were paying too much. Complexity creates information asymmetry, and information asymmetry creates profit opportunities for the person who understands the product better than the buyer.\n\nThink about what this means. The rating agencies – whose job was to evaluate these securities – probably couldn't fully understand the more complex structures either. But they rated them anyway, slapping AAA ratings on securities backed by subprime mortgages. Pension funds and insurance companies bought them because they trusted those ratings and because the yields looked attractive. Nobody wanted to admit they didn't understand what they were buying.\n\nThis gets to a fundamental principle I've followed throughout my career: never invest in something you don't understand. If you can't explain in simple terms how a financial product works and where the returns come from, you shouldn't own it. Complexity is not sophistication – usually it's the opposite. The best investments are often the simplest to understand.\n\nThe mortgage crisis also demonstrates how financial innovation can be destructive rather than productive. Real innovation creates value – it makes things better, cheaper, or more accessible. But much of what Wall Street calls innovation is just complexity for complexity's sake, designed to generate fees and obscure risks. These mortgage-backed securities didn't help borrowers get better loans or help investors get better returns. They just created more opportunities for intermediaries to extract fees while distributing risk to people who didn't understand what they were taking on.\n\nBarney Frank got it right when he identified the lack of risk retention as a major weakness in Dodd-Frank implementation. But I'd go further – we should be deeply skeptical of any financial product that requires a PhD to understand. The question to ask isn't \"How sophisticated is this?\" but rather \"Who benefits from this complexity?\" Usually, it's not the customer.\n\nThe lesson for investors is clear: when someone tries to sell you something complicated, especially if they're making it sound like you're not smart enough to understand it, run the other way. The best businesses and investments are usually the ones you can explain to a reasonably intelligent person in five minutes. If it takes longer than that, there's probably someone trying to profit from your confusion."

The answer is that both things are simultaneously true – productivity gains are absolutely essential for societal progress, yet they can be devastating for individuals caught in the transition. We can't ignore either side of this equation.\n\nLet me start with the big picture, because it's crucial to understand. When we look back at agriculture over 115 years, the transformation is almost miraculous. We went from needing a huge portion of our workforce just to feed ourselves to having only 2% of workers on farms while producing vastly more food. Those tens of millions of people who would have been farm laborers are now doing other things – they're building computers, performing surgeries, teaching children, creating entertainment, and producing countless goods and services that make modern life possible. Without those productivity gains, we'd still be an agrarian society with a fraction of our current standard of living.\n\nThe same story played out in railroads. Moving freight now costs 55% less in real terms than it did in 1947, saving shippers $90 billion annually. That's $90 billion that flows through to lower prices for consumers and higher profits for businesses, which then gets reinvested in other productive activities. If we still needed three million railroad workers to move today's freight volume, the cost would be prohibitive and we simply wouldn't have the economic activity we enjoy today.\n\nBut here's where it gets uncomfortable, and we need to be honest about it. If you were one of those 1.35 million railroad workers in 1947, and over your career you watched your job disappear to automation and efficiency improvements, the \"greater good\" argument rings pretty hollow. You've got a mortgage, kids to feed, and skills that were valuable yesterday but aren't today. The benefits to society are real, but they're diffused across millions of people in the form of slightly lower prices and slightly higher living standards. Your pain is concentrated and immediate.\n\nThis is why I mentioned it was fortunate that horses couldn't vote. That sounds flip, but it makes a serious point. When tractors replaced horses, we didn't stop the progress out of sympathy for horses. But humans aren't horses – we vote, we have families, we feel economic anxiety, and we organize politically. A society that ignores the human cost of progress will eventually face a backlash against progress itself.\n\nThe right answer isn't to stop productivity improvements – that would impoverish everyone over time. But it's also not to simply shrug and say \"creative destruction\" while real people suffer. We need to think seriously about education, retraining, safety nets, and the pace of change. The gains from productivity are so enormous that we can afford to help people through transitions without stopping progress. What we can't afford is to be callous about it, because that breeds the kind of political movements that might actually try to stop progress altogether. The challenge is managing the transition humanely while preserving the innovation that makes everyone better off in the long run."

        "value": "The railroad story is a perfect example of how to think about business economics over time, and it illustrates several principles that apply across all industries. When you're looking at a business, you need to understand not just what it does today, but how the fundamental economics of the industry are evolving through productivity improvements.\n\nLook at what happened with railroads. In 1947, they moved 655 billion ton-miles of freight with 1.35 million workers. By 2014, they moved 1.85 trillion ton-miles – an increase of 182% – with only 187,000 workers, a reduction of 86%. That's not a small improvement; that's a complete transformation of the business model. The amount of freight moved per worker increased by roughly seventeen times. Think about what that means for the economics of the business.\n\nFirst, it means that railroads became vastly more competitive as a transportation method. That 55% reduction in inflation-adjusted prices didn't happen by accident – it happened because the cost structure improved so dramatically. When you can move the same freight with a fraction of the labor, and labor is a major cost component, you can cut prices and still improve margins. This is how industries become more valuable even while prices fall.\n\nSecond, and this is crucial for investors, these productivity improvements created enormous barriers to entry. The capital investment required to build a railroad network was always substantial, but now you also need the operational expertise to run it efficiently with modern technology. You can't just hire a bunch of workers and compete on service anymore. The efficient operators have such a cost advantage that new competition is essentially impossible. This is why BNSF is such a valuable asset for Berkshire.\n\nThird, notice how the benefits flow through the economy. Shippers save $90 billion annually in current dollars. Those shippers are manufacturers, agricultural companies, energy producers – the entire productive economy. When their transportation costs fall by 55%, they can either lower their prices, invest more in their businesses, or earn higher returns. Usually it's some combination of all three. This is how productivity in one industry multiplies through the entire economic system.\n\nNow, when I look at BNSF's numbers from 1996 – moving 411 million ton-miles with 45,000 employees – I'm seeing a business that's still in the middle of this productivity transformation. The question for us as owners is: How much more improvement is possible? What technologies or methods might further reduce costs? How do we invest in productivity improvements that will keep us competitive for the next fifty years?\n\nThis is very different from how many people think about investing. They look at current earnings, maybe project some growth, and calculate a return. But the really important question is about the underlying economics. Is this a business where productivity improvements will continue? Will those improvements strengthen our competitive position or erode it? In railroads, each improvement strengthens the position because the network is already built and can't be replicated economically.\n\nThe broader lesson is that productivity isn't just about cutting costs – it's about transforming the fundamental economics of an industry in ways that create durable competitive advantages. When you find a business where productivity improvements are ongoing, where they strengthen rather than weaken competitive positions, and where the benefits flow through to create more economic activity, you've found something special. That's what we have with BNSF, and it's what we're always looking for across all of Berkshire's businesses."

The truth is that productivity gains are absolutely essential for society's progress, but they can be devastating for individual workers caught in the transition. Both things are true simultaneously, and we need to be honest about that.\n\nLet me start with why productivity matters so much. When BHE produces more electricity with fewer workers, that's not just good for our shareholders – it's good for everyone who uses electricity. Those efficiency gains translate into lower costs, more reliable service, and freed-up human capital that can be deployed elsewhere in the economy. Over the long sweep of history, this is how societies become wealthier. If we still required the same number of workers to produce electricity as we did fifty years ago, we'd all be poorer. The same principle applies across every industry. This is why Americans today enjoy a standard of living that would have seemed like science fiction to our grandparents.\n\nBut here's where it gets painful, and where I think we need to be brutally honest: the benefits of productivity gains don't distribute evenly, and the costs can be catastrophic for specific individuals. When we talk about workers being \"redeployed\" or finding \"new opportunities,\" we're often using euphemisms that mask real human suffering. Those 1,600 workers in Maine who lost their jobs when Dexter folded – many of them were in their fifties or sixties, living in a small town with limited other employment options. Telling them that society as a whole benefits from cheaper shoes made in Asia is cold comfort when they can't pay their mortgage.\n\nThe New Bedford textile workers had it even worse. Many spoke only Portuguese and had spent their entire working lives developing skills that became obsolete. There's no training program that's going to turn a sixty-year-old textile worker who doesn't speak English into a software engineer or a healthcare worker. That's a fantasy we tell ourselves to feel better about the disruption we're causing.\n\nSo how do I reconcile this? I don't, really. I accept that both realities exist. As a business manager and capital allocator, my job is to pursue efficiency and productivity. When we own a business, we have an obligation to run it well, which means not carrying excess workers just to avoid difficult decisions. That would ultimately harm everyone, including the workers, because an inefficient business will eventually fail entirely.\n\nBut I also believe we as a society have an obligation to the workers who get displaced. The capitalists – and I'm certainly one of them – can take care of ourselves. We diversify, we have resources, we can absorb losses. The worker who loses his job at age fifty-five in a one-industry town doesn't have those options. The market system produces tremendous aggregate benefits, but it can be cruel to individuals. I think we need much better social support systems for displaced workers, though I'll admit I don't have all the answers for what those should look like. What I do know is that we shouldn't pretend the problem doesn't exist or that \"retraining\" is always a realistic solution."

This isn't blind faith or cheerleading – it's based on understanding the fundamental dynamics that have driven progress for over two centuries and show no signs of stopping.\n\nThe key insight is that innovation and productivity improvements are not one-time events – they're ongoing processes built into the fabric of market capitalism. Companies are constantly competing to serve customers better, cheaper, and faster. The ones that succeed grow and prosper. The ones that fail get replaced by better competitors. This creative destruction, as Schumpeter called it, means that the overall system keeps improving even as individual companies come and go. Look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average: almost none of the companies in the index today were there a hundred years ago, yet the index itself grew from 66 to over 11,000. That's the beauty of the system.\n\nThink about what that means in practical terms. A century ago, we were just figuring out how to mass-produce automobiles. There was no air travel, no computers, no internet, no modern medicine to speak of. Each generation of Americans has seen innovations that created entirely new industries and made existing ones far more productive. Why would that stop? Human beings are creative, ambitious, and competitive. Give them a market system with proper incentives, and they'll keep finding ways to create value.\n\nNow, here's the critical part that many investors miss: you don't need to identify which specific companies will be the winners to benefit from this process. In fact, trying to pick the winners is where most people get into trouble. During the 20th century, thousands of auto companies were started. Almost all of them failed. If you'd tried to pick which one or two would dominate, you'd probably have been wrong. But if you'd simply owned a diversified basket of American businesses and held on, you'd have done wonderfully, because the winners more than compensated for the losers.\n\nThis is why I'm such a strong advocate for index funds for most investors. When you buy a broad market index and hold it, you're essentially betting on American business as a whole. You're saying, \"I don't know which companies will win, but I'm confident that the overall system will continue to create value.\" That's a bet that has paid off consistently for over two centuries, through wars, depressions, financial crises, and every other calamity you can imagine.\n\nThe \"sit tight\" part is equally important. The market will have bad years, bad decades even. There will be crashes and panics and moments when it feels like the sky is falling. But if you sell during those periods, you lock in your losses and miss the recovery. The investors who prosper are the ones who can psychologically handle the volatility and stay invested through the rough patches. This is harder than it sounds – it requires real discipline to watch your portfolio drop thirty or forty percent and not panic.\n\nWhat I'm describing here is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a get-rich-slowly approach that requires patience and emotional stability. But it works. The math is inexorable: if American business continues to become more productive and profitable over time – and I believe it will – then owners of American business will prosper. You just need to be an owner for the long term, diversify so that no single company's failure can hurt you badly, and have the fortitude to ignore the daily noise and stay focused on the decades-long trend. It's simple, but simple doesn't mean easy. The hardest part is usually controlling your own emotions and avoiding the temptation to trade in and out based on predictions about what the market will do next year or next month."

The answer is straightforward: we must embrace productivity improvements while simultaneously creating robust safety nets for displaced workers. These aren't contradictory goals – they're both essential to a functioning, moral society.\n\nLet me explain why restraining productivity is such a terrible idea. If we had decided back in 1900 that we needed to protect farming jobs, we'd have kept 11 million Americans working in agriculture when today we need only a fraction of that number to feed our entire nation and much of the world. Every American would be dramatically poorer. We wouldn't have the doctors, teachers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who emerged because we freed up all that human capital. The same logic applies to my textile workers in New Bedford or to coal workers today. Protecting obsolete jobs doesn't create prosperity – it freezes society in place and makes everyone worse off over time.\n\nBut here's where it gets morally complicated, and this is what people miss when they talk about \"creative destruction\" like it's some abstract economic theory. Those Portuguese-speaking workers in New Bedford weren't statistics in an economics textbook. They were real people, often in their fifties or sixties, who had worked hard their entire lives. They had no Plan B. When I say that, I mean they literally had no other options – limited English, specialized skills that were becoming worthless, and communities built around an industry that was dying. The market was telling them their labor had little value, but that doesn't mean they had no value as human beings.\n\nThis is why I'm such a strong advocate for something like an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. The principle is simple: if you're willing to work, America should work for you. We shouldn't be in the business of protecting specific jobs, but we absolutely should be in the business of protecting people who are willing to contribute. The EITC does this beautifully because it encourages work while supplementing wages that the market alone might set too low for a decent life.\n\nThink about the math here. The productivity gains from technological progress create enormous wealth. We're not talking about a zero-sum game where some people win and others must lose. The pie gets much, much bigger. What we're really discussing is how to distribute some of those gains to ensure that the people displaced by progress can still live with dignity. This isn't charity – it's enlightened self-interest. A society that tells willing workers \"the market has no use for you, good luck\" is a society that will eventually tear itself apart.\n\nThe key insight is this: the price of ever-increasing prosperity for the majority should not be penury for the unfortunate. We can afford both progress and compassion. In fact, we can't afford to choose between them. Any economic system that produces mass prosperity while leaving willing workers in poverty is ultimately unsustainable, both economically and morally."

I've read thousands of 10-Ks over my career, and I can't recall a single instance where the risk section told me something useful that I didn't already know. That's not because companies are hiding anything – it's because listing risks without context is almost meaningless.\n\nLet me break down why these disclosures fall short. They fail on three critical dimensions. First, they don't help you assess the probability of the risk actually occurring. Second, they don't give you any sense of the range of potential costs if it does occur. And third, they provide no guidance on timing. These three factors are everything when it comes to evaluating risk. A threat that might cost you $100 million with a 50% probability next year is radically different from a threat that might cost you $100 million with a 1% probability fifty years from now. Yet both might appear in a 10-K risk section with roughly equal prominence.\n\nHere's how I actually think about risk at Berkshire. Take the examples I mentioned: BNSF will certainly lose coal volume, GEICO might eventually be affected by driverless cars, our newspapers will see continued circulation declines, and online retailing threatens some of our consumer brands. Notice what I'm doing here – I'm not just listing risks, I'm making judgments about probability and timing. Coal volume will decline, that's certain. But driverless cars affecting GEICO? That's further out, and even when it happens, the impact is unclear. Maybe accident rates drop and so do premiums, but maybe we still insure the cars and our underwriting advantage persists.\n\nThe crucial question isn't whether risks exist – of course they do. The question is whether any single risk or combination of risks threatens the fundamental long-term health of the enterprise. When we bought Berkshire in 1965, the risk could be stated in one sentence: we were in a dying business with all our capital trapped in it. That's an existential risk. What we face now at Berkshire is completely different. We operate in dozens of industries, each with its own risks and opportunities, but none of them individually can sink the ship.\n\nThis diversification isn't just about spreading risk in the conventional sense. It's about ensuring that we're never in a position where we're forced to make desperate decisions. Charlie and I and our CEOs often disagree significantly about the probability, timing, and magnitude of various risks and opportunities. That's actually healthy. It means we're thinking hard about these issues, not just checking boxes for the SEC.\n\nThe real insight for investors is this: you need to distinguish between risks that are knowable and important versus risks that are either unknowable or immaterial. Most casual followers of business news already know about the threats facing railroads, insurance companies, newspapers, and retailers. The question isn't whether you know about these risks – it's whether you can assess their magnitude and timing well enough to make an intelligent investment decision. If you can't, you shouldn't invest in that business. But don't fool yourself into thinking that a longer list of risks in a 10-K makes you better informed. It usually just means the lawyers were more thorough."

It's not just an advantage – it's the difference between survival and extinction in the business world.\n\nLet me take you back to 1965 when we took control of Berkshire. We had a company whose entire capital was tied up in northern textile manufacturing, a business that was clearly dying. The risk assessment was brutally simple: we owned a melting ice cube. The northern textile industry was destined for recurring losses and would eventually disappear. And you know what? That's exactly what happened. But here's the crucial point – that development wasn't a death knell for Berkshire because we weren't trapped in that single industry.\n\nThe fundamental principle here is optionality. When you're a one-industry company and that industry faces structural decline, your options are severely limited. You can try to be the best buggy whip manufacturer in the world, but you're still making buggy whips. Management might be brilliant at operational efficiency, but they're constrained by the economics of their industry. They can't suddenly decide to deploy their capital into insurance or railroads or candy companies when their core business deteriorates.\n\nBerkshire, by contrast, operates as a capital allocation machine. Every single day, our managers are thinking about how to compete better in their specific businesses. But simultaneously, Charlie and I are thinking about where our steady stream of funds should be deployed. We can move capital from declining opportunities to growing ones. We can exit businesses entirely and redeploy that capital elsewhere. We're not emotionally or structurally wedded to any particular industry.\n\nThis adaptability compounds over time in powerful ways. When we see the textile business declining, we don't pour good money after bad trying to revive it. Instead, we harvest what we can and move that capital to insurance, which generates float we can invest. Then we use that float to buy wholly-owned businesses and stocks. Each successful redeployment gives us more capital to redeploy again. It's a virtuous cycle that only works if you maintain flexibility.\n\nThe broader lesson for investors and business owners is this: never fall so in love with a particular business or industry that you can't see when it's time to move on. The world is always changing. Industries rise and fall. Technologies disrupt old business models. The companies that survive and thrive over decades are those that can adapt to these changes, not those that stubbornly cling to what worked in the past.\n\nThis is why we've structured Berkshire the way we have. We're not trying to be the best at any one thing. We're trying to be the best at recognizing good businesses, deploying capital intelligently, and adapting as circumstances change. That's been our formula for nearly sixty years, and it's why I firmly believe Berkshire has the money, talent, and culture to plow through whatever adversities come our way and emerge with ever-greater earning power."

A successful large-scale attack on the United States – whether cyber, biological, nuclear, or chemical – would almost certainly decimate the value of all equity investments. There's no special portfolio construction or insurance policy that shields you from this. If such an event occurs, the value of American corporations would collapse, and \"the day after\" would look nothing like the world we know. As Einstein said after observing the atomic bomb, World War IV would be fought with sticks and stones.\n\nNow, here's where clear thinking becomes essential. The probability of such an event in any given year is likely very small. We've gone more than seventy years since that Washington Post headline I delivered as a boy announced the first atomic bomb. We've had close calls, but we've avoided catastrophic destruction through a combination of good government policy and, frankly, luck.\n\nBut – and this is crucial – what's a small probability in a short period approaches certainty over longer timeframes. If there's only a one-in-thirty chance of something happening in a given year, there's a 96.6% likelihood it happens at least once in a century. The mathematics are inescapable. And the bad news gets worse: there will forever be people, organizations, and perhaps nations that want to inflict maximum damage on our country, and their means of doing so have increased exponentially during my lifetime. Innovation has a dark side.\n\nSo what should an investor do with this information? You have several choices, none of them perfect.\n\nYou could refuse to invest in equities at all, keeping everything in cash or short-term bonds. But then you're guaranteeing yourself a loss to inflation and opportunity cost. You're essentially paying a huge insurance premium against an event that, while potentially catastrophic, remains unlikely in any given period.\n\nYou could invest in other countries, but most developed nations face similar risks, and many face even greater ones. Plus, you'd be betting against American resilience and adaptability, which has been a losing bet throughout our history.\n\nOr you can do what Charlie and I do: acknowledge the risk, recognize you can't eliminate it, and invest anyway based on the probabilities. We accept that Berkshire shares this risk with all of American business. We can't shed it, and we won't pretend we can. But we also recognize that refusing to participate in American enterprise because of this tail risk would mean missing out on the extraordinary wealth creation that's occurred over decades and centuries.\n\nThe practical wisdom here is to distinguish between risks you can manage and risks you simply must accept as the price of participation. Spend your energy on the former – buying good businesses at fair prices, maintaining financial strength, thinking long-term. Don't waste energy worrying about the latter, because worry without the ability to act is just corrosive anxiety. Accept that some risks are simply part of being alive and invested in human civilization, and make your decisions accordingly."

If there's even a small probability of catastrophic, irreversible damage to the planet, then taking precautionary action makes perfect sense. The asymmetry is enormous. The cost of action is manageable, while the cost of inaction could be civilization-altering. You don't wait for 100% certainty when you're talking about potentially crossing a point of no return. That's just basic risk management applied to the biggest possible scale.\n\nBut here's where people get confused. They assume that because climate change poses risks to society, it must pose equivalent risks to an insurance company. That's not how insurance economics work, and this is crucial to understand.\n\nInsurance companies don't make long-term, fixed-price commitments. We're not selling twenty-year policies at locked-in rates. We write one-year policies and reprice them annually based on our current assessment of risk. This is fundamentally different from, say, owning coastal real estate or operating a business dependent on stable weather patterns. Those involve long-duration exposures where you can't easily adjust.\n\nThink about the GEICO example I mentioned. In 1951, average loss per policy was about thirty dollars. By 2015, it was around a thousand dollars. That's more than a thirty-fold increase! If we'd been locked into 1951 pricing, we'd have been bankrupted decades ago. But we weren't locked in. As repair costs rose due to inflation, as medical costs increased, as cars became more expensive to fix, we simply raised premiums to match. The business didn't become less profitable. It became more profitable because the premium base grew enormously.\n\nThe same principle applies to climate-related risks. If hurricanes become more frequent or more severe, if weather events become costlier, we'll know it quickly from our loss data. And we'll respond by raising prices. In fact, increased risk often means increased profitability for insurers because it drives more demand for coverage and justifies higher premium rates. When people perceive greater danger, they're more willing to pay for protection.\n\nNow, there's a critical caveat here. This works because insurance is repriced frequently and because we have the discipline to walk away from business that isn't priced adequately. Notice I mentioned that super-cat rates have actually fallen in recent years because losses haven't materialized as some predicted. When prices are inadequate, we reduce our exposure. We're not obligated to write business at any price.\n\nSo as a citizen, I can be genuinely concerned about climate change's impact on communities, on people in low-lying areas, on the global ecosystem. Those are real, serious concerns. But as a shareholder evaluating Berkshire's insurance operations, I'm looking at a business model that's specifically designed to adapt to changing risk levels through annual repricing. The insurance business isn't threatened by climate change. If anything, it might benefit from increased demand for coverage and higher premium rates, assuming we maintain pricing discipline."

        "value": "This gets at something I've thought about throughout my entire career: how do you make sound judgments in areas where you're not an expert? It's one of the most important questions any business person or investor faces, and there's no simple formula, but there are some principles I've found useful.\n\nFirst, let me be clear about what I mean by having no scientific aptitude. I can't evaluate climate models. I can't assess the physics of greenhouse gases. I can't run the calculations on feedback loops in the atmosphere. These require specialized knowledge I simply don't possess. And I'm not going to pretend otherwise. One of the most dangerous things in business is people who don't know what they don't know.\n\nBut here's the key insight: acknowledging your limitations doesn't mean you can't make reasonable decisions. It means you need to think probabilistically and focus on the decision framework rather than claiming certainty about technical details.\n\nLook at how I approached the climate question. I didn't say \"I'm certain climate change will be catastrophic\" or \"I'm certain it won't be.\" I said it seems \"highly likely\" that it poses a major problem. That's a probability judgment, not a scientific conclusion. And then, critically, I shifted the question from \"what's the exact probability?\" to \"what's the right decision framework given uncertainty?\"\n\nThat's where Pascal's Wager becomes useful. Pascal wasn't claiming to prove God's existence. He was making an argument about decision-making under uncertainty. When the potential downside is enormous and irreversible, and the cost of precautionary action is manageable, you don't need high probability to justify action. You need only a reasonable possibility of a catastrophic outcome.\n\nNow, about Y2K. I mention it not to dismiss expert predictions generally, but to maintain appropriate skepticism. Experts can be wrong, sometimes spectacularly so. The computer experts predicting Y2K disasters weren't charlatans. They had legitimate technical knowledge. But they overestimated the risk, or underestimated our ability to address it, or something. The point is that expert consensus, while valuable, isn't infallible.\n\nSo how do you navigate this? I look for a few things. First, is there broad consensus among people who actually study the issue? With climate change, the scientific consensus is quite strong. That doesn't make it certain, but it's meaningful. Second, what's the quality of the dissenting arguments? Are they coming from credible sources or from people with obvious conflicts of interest? Third, and most important, what does the decision framework look like?\n\nThis last point is crucial and often overlooked. Even if I can't evaluate the science directly, I can evaluate the logic of risk management. If there's a reasonable chance of catastrophic, irreversible harm, and if action now could prevent it while delay might make it impossible to address, then waiting for perfect certainty is foolish. That's not a scientific judgment. That's a logical framework for decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nIn business, we face this constantly. I can't personally audit every company we might acquire. I can't personally assess every technology or market trend. But I can look at management quality, business models, competitive positions, and financial characteristics. I can ask whether I understand the business well enough to make a reasonable probability judgment about its future.\n\nThe key is staying within what Charlie Munger and I call your circle of competence. But that doesn't mean only acting when you're an expert. It means knowing what level of understanding you need for a particular decision, being honest about whether you have it, and structuring decisions to account for your uncertainty. Sometimes that means passing on opportunities. Sometimes it means taking precautionary action even without certainty. The wisdom is knowing which approach fits which situation."
