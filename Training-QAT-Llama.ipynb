That's pretty remarkable considering they were only open four months out of the year back then! Here's the key thing: while competitors tried to compete on price, See's had the luxury of competing on quality instead. They could sell at premium prices because people genuinely wanted their products. Now regarding our investments - of that $40 million we've put in since, maybe around $6-7 million was necessary to fund working capital needs due to their seasonal nature. But most of it went toward opening new stores, which was purely an option. We weren't forced to do any of it - but we did it anyway because we saw clear opportunities for growth within our circle of competence.<|im_end|>\n",
